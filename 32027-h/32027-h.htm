<h2>EDITOR'S PREFACE</h2>


<p>In Europe the average man looks upon the
bank as a benefactor. Through its agency
he secures capital at low rates for his business.
In America the bank is too often regarded
as a necessary evil, certainly not with
affection. Yet it plays a most important r&ocirc;le
in the nation's economy. Our banking laws
are obsolete, unsatisfactory, and actually in
some instances detrimental to the best and
widest use of the nation's resources. Europe
has many lessons for us in the problem of how
best to use our accumulations. With agriculture
demanding and the railroads calling for
more capital, the question of scientific banking
assumes new proportions. This book, with
its chapters on commercial and investment
banking, will help to a better knowledge.</p>

<h2>AUTHOR'S PREFACE</h2>


<p>The purpose of this book is to supply the general reader with a simple
statement of the principles and problems of banking. Since it is
designed primarily for American readers, special attention has been
given to conditions in this country. An effort has been made clearly
to draw the line between commercial and investment banking and to
indicate the problems peculiar to each. That it may assist the average
person in understanding present-day banking problems and thus
contribute towards the formation of a sound public opinion regarding
them, is the author's hope and desire.</p>

<h1>BANKING</h1>



<h2>CHAPTER I<br /><br />

<span class="smcap">The Nature, Functions, and Classification of Banking Institutions</span></h2>


<p>The terms, "bank" and "banking," are
applied to institutions and to businesses
which differ considerably in character, functions,
and methods, but which nevertheless
have certain common features which justify
their being grouped together. We can best
prepare the way for a discussion of these
differences and common features by a description
of the services which these institutions
perform in modern society.</p>


<h4><i>1. Services Performed by Banking Institutions</i></h4>

<p>From the point of view of their customers
these services may be grouped under the following
heads: The safekeeping of money and
other valuables; the making of payments; the
making of loans; and the making of invest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>ments.
It is a common practice everywhere,
and in some countries, notably the United
States, almost a universal practice for people
to intrust their money to banks for safekeeping.
To a degree, hoarding, in the sense of locking
up money in private vaults and other receptacles
and keeping it under the eye and in the
personal care of the owner, is still practiced,
but it is doubtless on the wane in all civilized
countries. The practice of intrusting to banks
the safekeeping of other valuables, such as
important documents, jewelry, plate, etc., is
also widespread and growing.</p>

<p>The service of the safekeeping of money
naturally leads to the second, the making of
payments. When we intrust our means of payment
to a bank, it is natural that we should
also make it our treasurer and disbursing
agent, and so we do. If we have payments
to make to people at home, in other cities of
our own country, or in other countries, we
usually order our bank to perform the service
for us.</p>

<p>Loans of almost all kinds are made by banks,
and certain kinds, namely, those to business
men for the everyday conduct of commerce
and industry, are made almost exclusively by
them. For the most part these are short-term<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
loans. For long-term loans banks are also
one of the chief resorts, but in some countries
these are not to so great a degree monopolized
by them as the short-term variety.</p>

<p>For the investment of the surplus funds of
people banks are the chief agencies. This function
takes the form mainly of the sale of
stocks, bonds, and mortgages, and sometimes
of the promotion of new enterprises.</p>

<p>None of these services are performed by banks
exclusively. For the safekeeping of valuables,
and sometimes of money, there are in some
places safe deposit companies to which the
term "banks" is not applied. In the making
of payments the post office departments of governments
and express companies participate,
and in the making of loans and investments
brokers, loan companies, lawyers, etc., participate.
The peculiarity of banking institutions
consists not in the performance of any one of
these services, but in the fact that they specialize
in them all, or in a combination of them.
Merely to keep money and valuables on deposit,
or to act as paymaster, or to make loans, or
to sell bonds, stocks, and mortgages would not
make an institution a bank or an individual a
banker; but to make a business of performing
most or all of these services for the public<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
involves the use of certain machinery and certain
methods of procedure, and the assumption
of a r&ocirc;le in the nation's economy which is distinctive
and peculiar, and which has set these
institutions apart in every country as objects
of legislation and of scientific treatment, as
well as in the thought and regard of the people.</p>


<h4><i>2. The Economic Functions of Banks</i></h4>

<p>Viewed from the standpoint of the nation
rather than from that of individuals, the functions
of banks may be described as those of
intermediaries in exchanges and in the investment
of capital. In the former capacity they
supply the world with the major part of its
medium of exchange and serve as distributing
agents for that portion of the supply which
comes from other sources. They create a
medium of exchange through a process of
bookkeeping which is world-wide in extent,
and through which the mutual indebtedness of
individuals, cities, and other subdivisions of
countries and nations, brought about by purchases
and sales on credit, are offset without
the use of money.</p>

<p>The practice of depositing surplus funds
with banks for safekeeping and consequently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
of using them as paymasters has resulted in the
reliance of everybody upon banks for currency
in any form, and has thus thrown upon them
the responsibility of directly utilizing all the
sources of money supply. Thus while the
mints of the United States and most other
countries coin gold bullion, and supply subsidiary
silver and copper and nickel coins to
private persons on the same terms as to banks,
as a matter of fact few private persons take
advantage of this privilege, finding it more
convenient and profitable to get the coin they
want from banks. The same is true of government
notes in countries in which such notes
constitute a portion of the currency.</p>

<p>The accumulation of a nation's capital
and its investment require the cooperation of
numerous agencies of which banks are the
chief. They collect the savings of the people,
combine them into amounts of sufficient size
for investment purposes, and invest them
temporarily and sometimes permanently. Cooperating
agencies in this work are insurance
companies, societies of various kinds for the
promotion of saving, stock exchanges, promoters,
etc. Some of these take the place of
banks in the performance of these services,
while others supplement and aid them.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>3. Classification of Banking Institutions</i></h4>

<p>Banks differ from one another chiefly in
the nature and degree of their specialization,
in legal status, and in the place they occupy
in the system to which they belong. Some
banks devote the major portion of their effort
to the conduct of exchanges and are called
<i>commercial</i> banks, others to investment banking
and are called <i>investment</i> banks. The
most common subclasses under the latter
head are savings banks, land or mortgage
banks, and bond houses. Savings banks
specialize in the collection and investment of
small savings; land banks are primarily intermediaries
between capitalists and people who
wish to invest capital in land, building operations,
and agriculture; and bond houses are
intermediaries between capitalists and those
who wish to invest capital in industrial, commercial,
and transportation enterprises, or loan
it to states, cities, or other public corporations.</p>

<p>Commercial banks rarely confine themselves
exclusively to the conduct of exchanges. Most
of them also conduct savings departments and
invest the funds intrusted to them through
such departments in agricultural, industrial, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
commercial enterprises or loan them to public
corporations. Commercial banking, however,
is their main concern, their other departments
being side issues of greater or less importance
according to circumstances. Investment banks
also frequently carry on commercial banking
as a side issue. These two lines of business
are sometimes mixed in such proportions as
to render classification difficult.</p>

<p>From a legal point of view the banks of
nearly all countries may be classified as
<i>private</i> or unincorporated, and <i>incorporated</i>,
sometimes also called joint-stock banks.
Private banks are started by individuals or
firms, like any other private enterprise, without
the formality of application for permission
to some public officer, and without compliance
with a set of legally prescribed regulations.
They are subject to the laws of the country
governing all kinds of private business enterprises
and sometimes to special laws applying
specifically to them. In some of the states of
the United States such banks are prohibited
by law.</p>

<p>Incorporated banks are usually started by
private initiative but owe their actual legal
existence and status to a special law, to the
requirements of which they must conform<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
before they are permitted to do business. Their
right to do business is usually evidenced by a
document known as a charter, executed and
delivered by a public officer legally endowed
with the requisite authority, or passed in the
form of a law by the legislative organs of the
state. Charters of the latter kind are known
as special charters and are rarely used nowadays,
except in the case of institutions of a
peculiar character, endowed with special functions.
The central banks of Europe owe their
existence to such charters, as did also the first
and second United States banks. In the early
history of the United States special charters
were uniformly employed by the states, but
for many years general incorporation laws
have been the rule, on compliance with the
requirements of which persons who desire to
incorporate banks can secure charters.</p>

<p>In federal states, both the federal government
and the governments of the constituent
states frequently have and exercise the right
to incorporate banks. In the United States,
banks incorporated by the federal government
under the terms of a general law, originally
passed in 1863 and many times amended since
that date, are known as <i>national</i> banks, and
those incorporated by the states under the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
terms of general banking acts or of general
incorporation laws are known as <i>state</i> banks.
These latter are endowed with privileges which
enable them to exercise commercial and some
investment banking functions. Other banks
also are incorporated by our states under the
terms of general laws, which are known as savings
banks and trust companies. The former,
as the name implies, are institutions primarily
designed for the encouragement, collection, and
investment of savings. The latter are called
trust companies because the earliest institutions
of this type made the execution of trusts of
various kinds their exclusive business. Banking
functions were later added and in many
cases have now assumed chief importance.</p>

<p>The nature of the banking business requires
some kind of organization of the individual
institutions in which certain ones will assume
to a degree at least the r&ocirc;le of bankers' banks.
In most European countries this position is
occupied by single institutions specially chartered
and endowed with special privileges and
usually described as central banks. Examples
are the Bank of England in England, the Bank
of France in France, and the Imperial Bank
of Germany in Germany. Around these are
grouped the other institutions in a kind of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
hierarchy, certain large banks in the larger
cities forming centers about which smaller institutions
group themselves. In the United
States there is no single central institution,
but a small group of banks in New York City
are the real centers of the system. Around
these are grouped the banks in the other large
cities of the country and these in turn perform
important services for banks in the surrounding
smaller towns and country districts.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br /><br />

<span class="smcap">The Nature and Operations of Commercial Banking</span></h2>


<p>In the preceding chapter commercial banking
has been defined as the conduct of exchanges
by means of a world-wide process of
bookkeeping. We must now describe this
process. Its essential features are the discount
of commercial paper, the conduct of checking
accounts, and the issue of notes.</p>


<h4><i>1. Commercial Paper</i></h4>

<p>By commercial paper is meant the credit
instruments or documents which the credit system
now in general use throughout the commercial
world regularly brings into existence
and liquidates.</p>

<p>The essence of this system is buying and selling
<i>on time</i>. The farmer buys seed, implements,
fertilizer, labor, etc., and pays for them
after the crops have been harvested and sold.
The manufacturer buys raw materials and pays<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
for them after they have passed through the
transformation process which he conducts and
the completed goods have been marketed. He
frequently sells them to jobbers or wholesalers
on time and these in turn sell them on time to
retailers and these to consumers. Farmers,
manufacturers, and merchants both buy on time
and sell on time, and are thus both debtors and
creditors, and each expects that his sales will
ultimately pay for his purchases.</p>

<p>The obligations involved in these transactions
are represented and recorded in the form
of book accounts, promissory notes, or bills
of exchange, the latter being written or printed,
or partly written and partly printed, orders of
creditors on debtors to pay to themselves or
to third parties the sums indicated. These
documents are being constantly made and constantly
paid as the processes of agriculture, industry,
and commerce proceed. Indeed, their
creation and liquidation is a normal phenomenon
of our modern economic life.</p>

<p>The term commercial paper, as we are using
it, applies to such promissory notes and bills
of exchange as belong to this credit system.
It does not apply to such notes and bills when
they owe their existence to credit operations of
a different kind, such for example as accom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>modation
loans or investment operations.
Indeed, the essential characteristic of commercial
paper is not revealed in the form of the
credit document but in the fact that it is a link
in this chain of exchange operations by which
modern commerce is carried on.</p>

<p>This use of the term should also be distinguished
from the one common among bankers
and others. In this popular usage these documents
are called commercial paper because they
are themselves objects of commerce. In our
use of the term the adjective "commercial"
applies to them only when they play the r&ocirc;le of
intermediary in a process of exchange through
credit. In this sense it is a matter of indifference
whether they pass through the hands of
brokers or not, and the fact of their being
objects of purchase and sale does not confer
the quality of commercial paper upon documents
having an origin and character other
than that above described.</p>


<h4><i>2. The Operation of Discount</i></h4>

<p>Every person in this chain of credit is confronted
with the problem of paying his debts
as they mature by the use of the amounts due
him from other people.  Since it is rarely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
possible to arrange maturities on both sides
in such a way that the amounts due to be paid
him at a given date shall at least equal those
he is due to pay on that date, some means of
transforming claims against other people due
in the future into present means of payment
must be found. The one universally employed
is the discount of commercial paper. By this
is meant the exchange at a bank of his own
promissory notes due at times when debts of
equal or greater amount due him mature, or
of bills of exchange drawn against his debtors,
for cash or credits on a checking account.
These latter are available as means of payment
at any time.</p>

<p>As a consideration for this accommodation,
the bank charges interest for the period intervening
before the maturity of the paper discounted.
Sometimes this charge is paid at the
time the paper is purchased and sometimes at
the date of its maturity. The term "discount"
technically means taking interest in advance by
making available as means of present payment
in any of the above mentioned forms a sum
less than the amount the bank expects to collect
at the date of the maturity of the discounted
paper. If the interest is paid when the discounted
paper matures, the process is tech<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>nically
called a loan. However, since the time
of collecting interest makes no essential difference
in the nature of the transaction, the
process is commonly described as the discount
of commercial paper, regardless of whether the
interest is collected in advance or not.</p>


<h4><i>3. The Conduct of Checking Accounts</i></h4>

<p>A checking account is an ordinary book
account on which are credited the cash deposited
by a customer and the proceeds of collections,
loans, and discounts made on his behalf,
and on which are debited payments made to
him in cash or on his behalf to other people or
to the bank itself. These payments are made
on orders signed by the customer and known
as checks.</p>

<p>The ordinary customer of a commercial bank
every day brings to the bank the cash he
receives as the result of the day's business, and
the checks received, drawn on his own and
other banks, and is credited with the amount on
the books of the bank as well as on a passbook
which he himself retains. If he needs cash
during the day, he presents to the bank a check
payable to himself for the amount needed, and
receives the kinds and denominations wanted;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
and if he wants to make payments to his creditors
in other forms than cash, he sends them
checks on his bank payable to their order, or a
check drawn by his bank on some bank in
another place, usually called a draft, which he
has obtained by exchanging for it a check
drawn to the order of his bank. To the
amount of these payments his account at the
bank is debited, and from time to time his passbook
is left at the bank for the entry therein
of the debits made to date and its subsequent
return to him.</p>

<p>The customer must take care that his
account is not overdrawn, that is, that the
debits on his account do not exceed the credits,
since overdrafts, except by accident or for
very short periods and small amounts, are not
allowed in this country, and in other countries,
where they are allowed, they must be provided
for in advance by a special agreement between
the bank and the customer, which usually
involves the deposit with the bank of ample
security. In order to avoid overdrafts, the customer
in this country agrees with his banker
on what is known as a "line," that is, a maximum
amount of loans or discounts to be
allowed. Whenever his credit balance falls
to a certain minimum, also established by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
agreement with the bank, the latter discounts
for him the paper of his customers, that is,
bills of exchange drawn on them or their
promissory notes in his favor, or his own
promissory notes. The proceeds of these discounts
are credited on his account like deposits
of cash or of checks for collection.</p>

<p>So long as the discounts are confined to commercial
paper the bank's part in these transactions
consists almost exclusively of bookkeeping
between its customers and between itself
and other banks. Ordinarily, what is debited
on one man's account is credited on another's,
the cash received nearly balancing that paid
out. To the extent that the cash receipts and
payments do not balance, the bank either has a
surplus or is obliged to provide for the meeting
of a deficit. The means available for this latter
purpose will be explained in subsequent sections,
as well as some of the details of this
bookkeeping process. For the present it is important
to note precisely how the discount of
commercial paper is related to this bookkeeping
process.</p>

<p>As explained in Section 1, commercial paper
is an essential part of the process of exchanging
goods through credit. A person buys on
time and sells on time and expects to pay for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
his purchases by the proceeds of his sales. So
long, therefore, as the processes of commerce
and industry proceed in a normal fashion, the
paper discounted by a bank will be paid at
maturity and the credit balance created by
means of such discounts offset by corresponding
debits. Ordinarily the credits created
through discounts during a given period, say
a day or a week, in favor of one set of customers
will be balanced during this same period
by the payment of notes previously discounted
for other customers. Within a complete trading
area this is certain to happen, since purchases
and sales of goods are equal and what
is credited to one man is debited to another.</p>

<p>The result is very different if a bank discounts
investment paper, that is, credit documents
which represent the unproductive consumption
of individuals or of public and private
corporations, or which represent the purchase
on time of the instruments of production rather
than the production of goods through the use
of such instruments and their transfer from
the producer to the consumer. The means of
payment of such documents can only be created
gradually by the application of the profits of
the enterprises in which the investments were
made, or by taxes spread over a series of years,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
or by a slow process of saving. If a bank
issues its own demand obligations in exchange
for such documents, it cannot make its books
balance and it will be constantly exposed to
the danger of forced liquidation. If it attempts
to protect itself by requiring that the discounted
paper shall mature in a short period, the necessity
of liquidation will be forced upon customers
who are responsible for the payment of the
discounted paper; that is, such customers will
be obliged to sell at such prices as they can
command the property in which the investments
were made, or some other property. Such
liquidation always results in forced readjustments
of prices and business depression, and
sometimes in commercial crises.</p>


<h4><i>4. The Issue of Notes</i></h4>

<p>As an alternative for or a supplement to the
conduct of checking accounts a commercial
bank may issue its promissory notes payable to
bearer on demand. By the issue of notes is
meant their transfer to customers in exchange
for cash, for checks left for collection or drawn
against a credit balance in a checking account,
or for discounted notes and bills.</p>

<p>By the use of these notes commercial bank<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>ing
can be carried on without checking
accounts. In that case the notes are issued in
exchange for cash and discounted bills, and
notes are returned to the bank in exchange for
cash or when discounted bills or notes mature
and are paid. In the bookkeeping process
which has been described bank notes thus
issued and returned perform precisely the same
function as checking accounts, and are related
to the discount of commercial paper and the
credit system of the country in precisely the
same manner as such accounts.</p>

<p>Most banks of issue at the present time conduct
checking accounts also, using the one
instrumentality or the other as their customers
desire. In this case notes are issued in exchange
for checks drawn against credit balances
on checking accounts or deposited for
collection as well as in exchange for discounted
notes and bills and cash.</p>

<p>By the use of both notes and checking accounts,
a bank can supply most of the needs
of its customers for a circulating medium, the
notes serving as hand-to-hand money, and the
checking accounts, practically all other purposes.
Being the direct obligations of banks
attested by the signatures of their responsible
officers, and being payable to bearer on demand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
and capable of being issued in all necessary
denominations, such notes can be transferred
without indorsement, can be used for making
change and payments of small and moderate
size for which checks are not convenient, and
they do not need to be presented at a bank for
the test of their validity. If the bank or banks
which issue them are properly conducted and
supervised and properly safeguarded by law,
such notes will circulate freely through the
length and breadth of a country.</p>

<p>Checking accounts meet in the most satisfactory
manner all currency needs for which
hand-to-hand money is not well adapted, such
as large payments and payments at a distance.
With a few strokes of a pen payments of the
greatest magnitude can be made through their
agency. Checks can be sent through the mails
at slight expense and without danger of loss
of the amount involved. By the devices known
as travelers' and commercial letters of credit,
checking accounts supply the most convenient
form of currency for travelers and for merchants
engaged in foreign trade.</p>

<p>Besides bank notes and checking accounts
the only forms of currency needed in any community
are standard and subsidiary coins, the
former for use as ultimate redemption material<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
for all other forms of currency and for the
payment of international and other balances,
and the latter for small change. Even these
forms of currency are supplied by commercial
banks, but since they do not create them, ways
and means of procuring them in the quantities
needed constitute one of their peculiar
problems.</p>


<h4><i>5. Collections</i></h4>

<p>One of the most important functions of commercial
banks is the collection for their customers
of checks and drafts drawn on other
institutions. When these documents are received,
the accounts of customers who deposited
them are credited with the amounts, less
a small fee for collection, unless by agreement
this service of collection is performed free of
charge. The checks are then assorted according
to the banks upon which they are drawn
and the cities in which those banks are located.</p>

<p>Checks drawn upon home banks are collected
either through messengers who present the
checks at the counters of the banks upon which
they are drawn and secure payment therefor,
or through the local clearing house. This is a
place where representatives of the banks meet
for the exchange of checks. After the repre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>sentative
of each bank has distributed all the
checks held by his institution against the
others participating in the clearing, and received
from them those drawn against his
bank, a balance sheet is prepared showing the
balance due by or to his bank after the total
of the checks distributed has been balanced
against the total received. If said balance is
adverse, it is paid to the master of the clearing
house, and if it is favorable, it is received
from him.</p>

<p>The checks received through the clearing
house or presented by messengers from other
banks and paid, are debited to the accounts of
the persons who drew them and returned to
such persons as vouchers, the net result of the
entire transaction being the same as if all the
parties involved had been customers of a single
bank, with the exception that some means of
paying balances had to be found. Since balances
are sometimes paid by checks on some
central institution in which credit balances
may be obtained by rediscounts of commercial
paper, this necessity can be met without the
use of any form of currency other than that
furnished by banks themselves.</p>

<p>Checks drawn upon out-of-town banks are, in this country, collected
through so-called cor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>respondents. Each bank enters into an
arrangement with a few other banks, distributed throughout the country
and conveniently located for the purpose, by which the correspondent
bank agrees to conduct with it a checking account on which it will
credit at par or at a stipulated discount the checks sent it for
collection and debit checks drawn against such an account. A
comparatively small number of such correspondents suffices, since
certain banks in the larger cities, by making a business of such
collections, conduct checking accounts with a large number of banks,
and can thus make collections by mere transfers of credits on their
own books or by the use of the local clearing house. The so-called
reserve cities in this country constitute clearing centers for the
territories contiguous to them, and New York, Chicago, and St. Louis,
for the entire country.</p>

<p>Checks received from correspondents and drawn against themselves are
debited to the accounts of the customers who drew them and returned as
vouchers in the same manner as checks received through the clearing
house or paid over their own counters.</p>

<p>Through this interchange of checks between banks and the conduct of
checking accounts with each other, intermunicipal and inter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>national
exchanges are conducted through the bookkeeping processes of
commercial banks with the same ease and economy as are exchanges
between people living in the same town.</p>


<h4><i>6. Domestic Exchange</i></h4>

<p>The accounts of a bank with its correspondents are a record of the
transactions of its customers with the outside world, the checks they
receive as a result of sales to outsiders of merchandise, real estate
or other property, or as a result of gifts by outsiders to them being
credited on such accounts, while the checks they draw or the drafts
they purchase in payment for merchandise, real estate or other
property purchased of outsiders, or of gifts made to them are debited.
When in a given period, say a day or a week, the receipts of the
customers of a bank from outsiders, as a result of current or past
sales and gifts, exceed the payments made by them as a result of
purchases and gifts, its credit balances with its correspondents will
increase, and under opposite conditions they will decrease. If the
payments should continue in excess for a considerable period, the
credit balances of a bank with its correspondents would be exhausted
and some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> means of replenishing them would have to be found, and under
the opposite conditions too large a portion of the bank's resources
would accumulate with its correspondents and some means of withdrawing
funds would have to be found.</p>

<p>When a bank needs to replenish its credit balances with its
correspondents, it may ship cash or purchase drafts from other home
banks, which it can send to its correspondents for collection like
checks deposited in the ordinary course of business. The latter
resource will of course be available only when these other banks'
balances with their correspondents are not exhausted. Should the
balances of all the banks of a town with their out-of-town
correspondents be nearly or quite exhausted, shipments of cash to
correspondents could not be avoided. If a bank wishes to withdraw
funds from its correspondents for home use, it may order cash shipped
or it may, perhaps, be able to sell drafts for cash to other home
banks.</p>

<p>The expenses involved in shipments of cash, loans, or purchases or
sales of drafts for the purpose of replenishing balances with or
withdrawing them from out-of-town correspondents, give rise to what is
called the <i>rate of exchange</i>. If, in order to make out-of-town<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
payments for its customers, a bank is obliged to pay the expense of
shipping cash to its correspondents or to pay a premium on drafts
purchased from other banks, the natural method of reimbursement will
be a premium charge on drafts sold equal to the amount of the expense
incurred. If it wishes to withdraw a balance with its correspondent,
since to order cash shipped will involve expense, it will be glad to
sell drafts for cash at a discount not to exceed such expense.</p>

<p>The rate of exchange, or the price of drafts on a given point, may,
therefore, fluctuate between a premium equal to the cost of shipping
cash to that point and a discount of the same amount. Beyond these
extremes, these fluctuations cannot ordinarily go, because customers
may demand cash of their banks in payment of checks against their own
credit balances and ship it to their out-of-town creditors at their
own expense, and would do so if the rates charged on drafts should
make such procedure profitable. The actual rate of exchange will not
ordinarily reach either of these extremes, on account of competition
either between the banks which are desirous of selling drafts on their
correspondents or between those which are forced to buy as an
alternative to cash ship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>ments. If the aggregate balances of the banks
of a town with their out-of-town correspondents are large and
increasing, the pressure to sell drafts will be greater than that to
buy and the rate of exchange will go to a discount, the amount of
which, however, will be fixed by competition between the selling
banks. In the opposite case, the rate will go to a premium and be
fixed by competition between the buying banks.</p>

<p>In most towns in the United States there is little or no competition
between banks in the business of buying and selling drafts and
consequently no open market for exchange and no quotations of exchange
rates. In such cases each bank acts more or less independently;
shipments of cash to or from correspondents are the ordinary means of
regulating balances; and the cost of such shipments are charged to the
general expense account of the bank and taken out of customers either
by a fixed and more or less invariable charge on drafts sold, or in
other ways.</p>

<p>Since the balances of the banks of a town with their out-of-town
correspondents depend primarily upon the commercial and gift relations
of their customers with the outside world, it is pertinent to inquire
whether as a result of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> a long continued excess of purchases from
outsiders over sales to them and of gifts to over gifts from them, the
cash resources of a community might not be completely exhausted, and
if not, how such an outcome is prevented.</p>

<p>Bankers have no direct control over the purchases and sales of their
customers, but through the rate of interest they charge on loans and
discounts and their ability absolutely to discontinue such
accommodations they exert a very potent indirect influence. The rates
of interest and discount charged are an important element in the cost
of doing business and, if loaning and discounting is discontinued,
sales of property to meet maturing obligations are forced, with the
result of price readjustments between the town in question and the
outside world which speedily change the relations between purchases
and sales.</p>

<p>When the cash resources of the banks of a town approach the limit of
safety and their balances with their correspondents fall to an
ominously low point, the normal method of procedure is to raise the
rates on loans and discounts, and if conditions grow worse, to raise
them higher still and as a last resort to cease temporarily to make
them at any price. By increasing the cost of doing business this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> rise
in the rates will check purchases by diminishing or annihilating the
profits resulting, and will stimulate sales by rendering it more
profitable for some customers to secure funds by sales to outsiders at
lower prices than were formerly asked rather than by borrowing from
banks. Under ordinary circumstances this procedure will be sufficient
to change an unfavorable into a favorable balance of indebtedness with
the outside world, with the result that more checks on outside
institutions will be deposited with the banks and a smaller amount of
drafts purchased. Bankers' balances with their correspondents will,
therefore, increase, and with them their ability to command cash in
case of need. The demands made upon them for cash will also decrease,
since the volume of loans and of business transacted will fall.</p>

<p>If the banks stop discounting, a more or less violent readjustment
with the outside world results. Business men who have obligations to
meet, and most of them will belong to this class, are obliged to sell
their goods and property at whatever prices are necessary and to stop
purchasing entirely. The outcome, so far as the banks are concerned,
is as above indicated. If conditions are such that sales<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> at any price
cannot be forced, a crisis ensues; that is, business operations are
temporarily suspended and transfers of property in settlement of
obligations are made through bankruptcy and other court proceedings.</p>


<h4><i>7. Foreign Exchange</i></h4>

<p>The business relations between banks located
in different countries do not differ in any essential
respect from those between banks located in
the same country. Interchange of checks, the
conduct of checking accounts, shipments of
cash, and borrowing and lending proceed in the
same manner as between domestic institutions.
The chief peculiarities of the foreign exchanges
are due to the fact that different units of value
and sometimes different standards must here be
reckoned with, and that the precious metals,
chiefly gold, are used in the settlement of balances.
Drafts drawn in the United States on
English points, for example, call for the payment
of pounds sterling, those on French
points for francs, and those on German points
for marks, while all must be paid for in dollars.</p>

<p>The translation of the language of values of
one country into that of others thus involved
requires the calculation of a so-called <i>par of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
exchange</i>. By this is meant the relation between
the weights of pure metal contained in
their respective units of value, if the countries
in question have the same standard, and the
relation between the market values of the
metallic content of their units, if their standards
are different. Thus the par of exchange
between this country and England is $4.8665,
since our dollar contains 23.22 grains of pure
gold and the English pound sterling 4.8665
times as many grains, or 113.0016. Our par
of exchange with France is 19.294 cents, the
quotient of 4.4802, the number of grains of
pure gold in the French franc, divided by 23.22.
Between China and the United States the par
of exchange is the market value in our dollars
of the amount of silver contained in the tael,
the Chinese unit.</p>

<p>Another technical term employed in connection
with the foreign exchanges is <i>the gold
points</i>. These are the points above and below
the par of exchange fixed by the addition in the
one case, and the subtraction in the other, of
the cost of shipping gold between the two places
in question. They are the points between
which the rates of exchange fluctuate, or the
points at which, when the rate of exchange
reaches them, gold moves between gold stand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>ard
countries. Assuming for example, that the
cost of shipping gold between New York and
London is two cents per pound sterling, the
gold points are 4.8865 and 4.8465, it being
profitable to ship gold from New York to London
when sterling exchange reaches the former
figure and to import gold from London when
it reaches the latter figure.</p>

<p>In the conduct of the foreign exchanges several classes of bills are
employed upon which the quotations differ, in part on account of
differences in their quality and in part on account of the interest
element entering into the value of time bills. For example, New York
regularly quotes on London <i>cables</i>, <i>demand</i>, and <i>sixty-day</i> bills.
The rates on a certain date were: Cables, 4.8860; demand, 4.8790; and
sixty days, 4.8370. Inasmuch as these are all bankers' bills and
consequently of the same quality, the differences in their quotations
are due to the interest element and to the fact that in the case of
the cables the cost of the cablegram is included.</p>

<p>When a New York banker sells a cable on London, his balance with his
correspondent is reduced by the amount in a few hours, and the
interest he receives on such balances is proportionately diminished at
once, and he is also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> out the cost of the necessary cablegram. When he
sells a demand bill, his account with his London correspondent remains
undiminished during the time required for sending the bill by mail
across the Atlantic and for its presentation for payment. He draws
interest on his entire balance during this period. When he sells a
sixty-day bill, his balance does not suffer diminution on its account
for sixty days. In order to place these bills on a footing of equality
so far as he is concerned, therefore, he must quote demand and
sixty-day bills lower than cables; the former by the cost of the
cablegram plus interest on the amount of the bill, say for ten days,
at the rate he receives on his London balance, and the latter by the
amount of the cablegram plus interest on the amount for sixty days at
the same rate.</p>

<p>Trade, or mercantile, as well as bankers' bills are also frequently
and, in some markets, regularly quoted. Being of a quality ranked as
inferior to bankers' bills, they must be negotiated at a lower rate
and are quoted accordingly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br /><br />

<span class="smcap">The Problems of Commercial Banking</span></h2>


<p>The conduct of commercial banking presents
problems both to the bankers and
to the public, the methods of solution of
which will be given attention at this point.
The problems concerning the bankers primarily
may be grouped under the heads, supply of
cash, selection of loans and discounts, and
rates; and those which primarily concern the
public may be grouped under the heads, protection
against unsound practices, and adequacy
and economy of service.</p>


<h4><i>1. The Supply of Cash</i></h4>

<p>The credit balances on checking accounts and
the notes of commercial banks are payable on
demand in the legal-tender money of the nation
to which they belong, and such banks must at
all times be prepared to meet these obligations.</p>

<p>The term employed to designate the funds
provided for this purpose is <i>reserves</i>, and in this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
country they consist of money kept on hand
and of credit balances in other banks. In other
countries there is also included under this head
commercial bills of the kind which can always
be discounted. The term <i>secondary reserve</i> is
sometimes employed in this country to designate
certain securities, such as high-class bonds
listed on the stock exchanges, which can be
sold readily for cash in case of need.</p>

<p>The amount of reserve required can be determined
only by experience. In ordinary times
it depends chiefly upon the habits of the community
in which the bank is located regarding
the use of hand-to-hand money as distinguished
from checks and upon the character of its customers.
These habits differ widely in different
nations, and considerably in the different
sections and classes of the same nation. In
most European and Oriental countries, for
example, checks are little used by the masses
of the people, while in the United States and
England they are widely used. In these latter
countries, however, they are less widely used
by people in the country than in the cities, and
by the laboring than the other classes in the
cities. Within the same city one bank may
need to keep larger reserves than another on
account of the peculiarities of the lines of busi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>ness
carried on by its customers and the classes
of people with whom it deals.</p>

<p>In times of crisis and other periods of extraordinary
demand, bank reserves must be
much larger than in ordinary times. Hoarding,
unusually large shipments of money to
foreign countries and between different sections
of the same country, and payments of
unusual magnitude, increase the demands for
cash made upon banks at such times.</p>

<p>The manner in which clearing and other balances
between banks are met also has an influence
on the amount of reserves required. If
such balances are paid daily and always in
cash, the amount needed for this purpose is
much larger than if they are paid in checks on
some one or a few institutions and at longer
intervals.</p>

<p>The note issue privileges of a bank also affect
its reserve requirements. Since, if not prohibited
by law, notes may be issued in all
denominations needed for hand-to-hand circulation
within a nation, and since for all purposes
except small change such notes are as
convenient as any other form of currency, a
bank with unrestricted issue privileges can supply
all the demands of its customers for currency
for domestic use, except those for small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
change, without resort to outside sources of
supply. In this case, however, it needs to keep
a reserve in order to meet demands for the
redemption of notes. Such demands arise on
account of the need of coin for small change
or for shipment abroad or of means for meeting
domestic clearing and other bank balances.
The aggregate needed for the supply of such
demands, however, is much less than would be
required if the privilege of issuing notes did
not exist.</p>

<p>In the maintenance of reserves the chief reliance
of commercial banks is the circulation of
standard coin within a nation and the importation
of such coin. The coin within the borders
of a nation passes regularly into the vaults of
banks by the process of deposit, and on account
of the credit balances they carry with foreign
institutions, the loans they are able to secure
from them, the commercial paper they hold
which is discountable in foreign markets, and
the bonds and stocks sometimes in their possession
which are salable there, they are able to
import large quantities in case of need. Since
the standard coin in existence in the world
adjusts itself to the need for it in substantially
the same manner that the supply of any other
instrument or commodity adjusts itself to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
demand, banks ordinarily have no difficulty in
supplying their needs, and under extraordinary
circumstances, though difficulties along this line
sometimes arise, means of overcoming them
are available which will be discussed in the
proper place.</p>

<p>If, as is the case in the United States, certain
forms of government notes are available as
bank reserves, these find their way into the
banks' vaults by the process of deposit in the
same manner as coin. The possession of such
notes by a bank enables it, to the extent of their
amount, to throw the responsibility for the
supply of standard coin upon the government,
and in the circulation of the country such notes
take the place of an equivalent amount of
standard coin. Whether or not a government
ought to assume such a responsibility is a question
which will be discussed in a subsequent
chapter.</p>

<p>For the nation as a whole, the balances in
other banks and the discountable commercial
paper and bonds which a bank may count as a
part of its reserves are not reserves except to
the extent that they may be employed as a
means of importing gold. They are only means
through which real reserves of standard coin
are distributed. The payment in cash of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
balance with another bank or the discount of
commercial paper with another domestic bank
or the sale of bonds on domestic stock exchanges
do not add to the sum total of the cash resources
of the banks of a nation. Their only effect is
to increase the cash resources of one bank at
the expense of another.</p>

<p>Adequate facilities for the distribution of
the reserve funds of a country, however, are
second in importance only to the existence of
adequate supplies of standard coin. If such
facilities are lacking, existing reserves can be
only partially and uneconomically used, with
the result that much larger aggregate reserves
are required than would otherwise be necessary
and that the entire credit system is much less
stable than it otherwise would be.</p>


<h4><i>2. The Selection of Loans and Discounts</i></h4>

<p>The problem of the reserves is vitally connected
with that of the selection of loans and
discounts. As was shown in the preceding
chapter, the chief business of a commercial
bank is to conduct exchanges by a process of
bookkeeping between individuals, banks, communities,
and nations. This process consists
primarily in the converting of commercial bills<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
and notes into credit balances and bank notes,
in the transfer of such balances and notes
between individuals and banks, and in the final
extinguishment of such balances and the return
of such notes at the maturity of the commercial
bills and notes in which the process
originated.</p>

<p>In this process there is little need for cash,
provided the arrangements between banks for
clearing checks and for the interchange of
notes are complete and efficiently administered.
But when a bank accepts investment in lieu of
commercial paper, its need for cash at once
increases, because the demand obligations created
by the credit balances or the bank notes
into which this paper was converted are not
extinguished by payments for goods purchased,
but must be met by cash.</p>

<p>To distinguish between commercial and investment
paper is, therefore, one of the chief problems
confronting commercial bankers. For its
solution an accurate knowledge of the business
operations of customers is necessary. An inspection
of the paper presented and a general knowledge
of their wealth and business capacity are
important, but not sufficient. The forms of
the paper employed in both commercial and
investment operations may be the same, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
possession of wealth does not ensure the payment
of the paper at maturity.</p>

<p>The chief means available for the acquisition
of this knowledge are the requirement from
customers of frequent statements of their operations,
on properly prepared forms; the use,
wherever possible, of the documented commercial
bill of exchange; and the maintenance of
credit departments equipped with the means of
accurately studying commercial, industrial, and
agricultural operations, and of diagnosing economic
conditions. The study of carefully prepared
statements of customers made at frequent
intervals reveals to the banker not only the
nature of the operations represented by the
paper presented for discount, but the trend
of the business of his customers and, through
them, of the entire country. With such knowledge,
he is not only able to protect his institution
against improper loans and discounts, but
to give valuable advice to his customers, advice
which no one else is in a position to give so
accurately.</p>

<p>By a documented bill of exchange is meant
a bill drawn by a seller upon the purchaser of
goods, accompanied by documents evidencing
the transaction; such, for example, as bills of
lading, warehouse receipts, and insurance poli<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>cies.
The names on such bills guide the banker
in his efforts to trace the transaction in which
it originated and the documents enable him
absolutely to identify it, and constitute security
for the loan.</p>

<p>Instead of such bills, promissory notes made
payable to banks are commonly used in this
country, greatly to the disadvantage of the banking
business. Such a note reveals nothing to
the banker concerning the purpose for which
the loan is made, while a commercial bill, even
without documents, reveals the names of the
principals of the transaction in which the banker
is asked to participate. Acquaintance with these
men and knowledge of the business in which
they are engaged at once suggests the probable
origin of the bill and furnishes the clue needed
for subsequent investigation.</p>

<p>A properly equipped credit department will
keep on file and at all times available for use
the data requisite for the information of the
officers upon whom the responsibility of selecting
the loans and discounts rests. Such data
will not only concern the character and business
of each customer and the bank's previous dealings
with him, but general economic conditions,
the operations and experiences of other banks,
other business institutions, governments, etc.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>3. Rates</i></h4>

<p>Besides rates of exchange considered in the
preceding chapter, commercial banks are concerned
with loan and discount rates.</p>

<p>Rates on deposits, though sometimes employed,
have no place in commercial banking,
since commercial deposits are only the credit
balances resulting from loans and discounts or
from funds intrusted to the bank for temporary
safekeeping or disbursement in the interest
of the depositor. In every case they represent
a service rendered the depositor for which the
bank must be paid, and, when interest is allowed,
the depositor must repay it in some form
with an increment sufficient to remunerate said
service.</p>

<p>Commercial banks may and usually do conduct
savings accounts also, for which an interest
payment is not only defensible but in every
sense desirable, but in so doing they are going
beyond the sphere of commercial banking, which
alone is under consideration at this point.</p>

<p>Rates charged on loans and discounts are
the chief means through which commercial
banks are remunerated for the services they
perform. In the long run these rates are deter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>mined
by competition, and represent the current
market value of the services performed by
bankers. Custom often affects them temporarily
and sometimes for long periods prevents
their response to influences tending to produce
change, but in the long run they yield to
economic force and conform to the laws of
value.</p>

<p>Variations in the rate of discount are the
most efficient means employed by commercial
banks for the regulation of the volume of
their loans and discounts and for changing
the percentage their reserves bear to deposits
and note issues. An increase of these rates
tends to check loans and discounts, to decrease
deposits and note issues, to increase reserves,
and consequently to raise the percentage of
reserves to deposits and issues.</p>

<p>It checks loans and discounts by increasing
the expense of conducting business operations
on a credit basis, thus diminishing profits and
sometimes causing losses, checking enterprise
and decreasing the volume of commercial transactions.
A decrease of loans and discounts
correspondingly diminishes deposits or note
issues, or both, since these are simply the counterpart
or representative of such loans and discounts
in the form of credit balances in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
checking accounts conducted by the banks or
the equivalent of such balances in a hand-to-hand
money form. An increase in the rate of
discount at a given point tends to attract funds
from other points where the rates are lower
and thus to increase reserves. A decrease of
rates produces opposite effects all along the
line.</p>


<h4><i>4. Protection against Unsound Practices</i></h4>

<p>Commercial banks are an essential part of
the machinery by which the agriculture, industry,
and commerce of a country are carried on,
and their proper conduct is, therefore, a matter
of public concern. On this account they have long
been subjects of legislation and of public supervision
and control. The methods evolved for
safeguarding the public against abuses and
unsound practices differ considerably among
different nations and to some extent among the
different states of the United States, and could
only be adequately explained by a history of
banking in each nation. Only the more important
and most widely used of them will be
described here.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Capital and Surplus Requirements and
Double Liability of Stockholders.</i>&mdash;A very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
common, indeed, almost universal, legal requirement
is that before beginning business
the proprietors of a commercial bank shall
contribute a fund to be known as the <i>capital
stock</i>, and that an additional fund, usually
called the <i>surplus</i>, shall afterwards be set
aside from profits. These funds are required
to be maintained intact, so long as the bank
continues in business, and to be used for the
payment of losses in case of failure or liquidation
for any reason. In this country it is also
customary to hold the proprietors legally liable
in case of failure for an assessment equal to the
amount of their capital stock. In foreign countries
it is a common practice to have the subscribed
considerably in excess of the paid-in
capital, the balance being subject to call by
the directors at any time, and being available
for the payment of losses in case of failure.</p>

<p>These funds serve not only as a protection
against loss to the customers of a bank in case
of failure, but also as a restraining influence
on the managers in the everyday conduct of
the bank's affairs. They constitute the proprietors'
stake in the business, what they are
likely to lose if the management is imprudent,
dishonest, or inefficient. The absence of such
funds would put a premium on rashness and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
speculation and tempt into the business the
unscrupulous and the unfit.</p>

<p>In the determination of the size of capital
and surplus funds and of the amount of the
liability of stockholders for subscriptions in
case of failure, no well-founded principles have
been developed for the guidance of legislators.
They should be great enough to cover prospective
losses and to induce conservatism, honesty,
and efficiency in management, and not so great
as to prevent the free flow of an adequate
amount of capital into the business. Unfortunately,
the statistics of losses in cases of failure
are not a sufficient guide. In some cases they
bear a large proportion to the volume of business
transacted and in others a very small one,
and the number of cases available are too small
to give much value to averages. The amount
necessary to secure the best possible management
is also purely problematical.</p>

<p>In lieu of well-founded principles, the practice
has developed in this country of making
the minimum capitalization permitted depend
upon the population of the town in which the
bank is located. This seems to be a very crude
and indirect method of proportioning capital
to the volume of business transacted. The
fixing of such a proportion, or of a proportion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
which no bank should be permitted to exceed,
is probably the best method of solving this
problem, but it should be done directly and
not by the roundabout method which has been
mentioned above.</p>

<p>A proportion of ten to one between capital
and aggregate demand obligations would probably
be justified by American experience. The
present practice of fixing the surplus fund at
twenty per cent of the capital would be
justifiable if the capital fund were properly
regulated in amount.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Inflation and Means of Protecting the
Public against It.</i>&mdash;The greatest abuse to
which the business of commercial banking is
subject, and against which the public most
needs protection, is inflation. This is a condition
difficult to diagnose, and not well understood
by the general public and even by bankers.
The most easily recognized symptom of its
existence is the forced liquidation of credits;
that is, forced sales of property in order to
meet maturing obligations to banks. When,
for example, the people whose notes or bills
have been discounted by banks default in
large numbers, and the collateral deposited as
security has to be sold, or, in the absence of
collateral, the courts must order the sale of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
their property, the presence of inflation may be
suspected.</p>

<p>The chief cause of inflation is the issue by
commercial banks of demand obligations against
investment securities. The means of liquidating
such securities are the profits of the enterprises
in which the investments were made
and in the nature of the case several years are
required for the accomplishment of this end.
Meantime the demand obligations of the banks
issued against them in the form of balances on
checking accounts or notes must be met and,
the funds regularly deposited with them as a
result of the operation of such enterprises being
inadequate, other means must be found. The
only one available is the sacrifice, at forced
sales, of the property in which the investment
was made or of some other property in the
possession of the persons responsible to the
bank.</p>

<p>The banks usually protect themselves against
such forced liquidation by the requirement that
the paper they discount shall mature at short
intervals, usually not to exceed four to six
months, and accept the long-time securities,
such as bonds, stocks, and mortgages, only as
collateral. By this means they are able to
force the liquidation on their customers. Other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>wise
they would be obliged themselves to endure
it, with the result that their capital and surplus
funds would be impaired and perhaps
exhausted; and, if they should prove inadequate,
failure would be inevitable.</p>

<p>The evil involved in the forced sales of property
caused by inflation is the readjustment of
prices through which it is accomplished, and
the depression and, sometimes, panic which
follow. When the prices of many kinds of
property must be greatly depressed in order
to induce their transfer to other hands, the
machinery of commerce and industry is thrown
out of adjustment and is sometimes rendered
temporarily useless. This result is due to the
fact that the relations between costs of production
and the returns from the sale of finished
products are so changed that profits are
reduced or annihilated, and many persons are
financially ruined. Readjustments of the prices
of raw products, labor, and finished goods, and
the transfer of plants to new hands, are, therefore,
necessary before industry, commerce, and
agriculture can again operate in a normal way,
and during the period of readjustment some
enterprises must entirely stop operations, and
all must slow down. At such times many
laborers are thrown out of employment, many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
more work part time only, the wages of nearly
all are lowered, and most other classes of
income are cut down. Depression and, in
extreme cases, panic are the result, and these
have serious consequences other than financial.</p>

<p>The means employed for the protection of
the public against inflation are crude and inadequate.
They may be grouped under the heads:
regulations regarding investments, reserves, and
note issues. Under the first head belong in
the banking legislation of this country limitations
on real estate investments and on the
amount that may be loaned to a single firm or
individual. Our national banking act and most
of our state banking acts prohibit banks from
holding real estate except for their own accommodation,
and as a means of reimbursing themselves
for defaulted loans, and our national
banking act prohibits the taking of real estate
security for loans, and many of our state banking
acts limit the amount of such security
that may be held. Our national banking act
limits the amount that may be loaned to a
single firm or individual to one-tenth of the
bank's capital and surplus, and similar regulations
are common in state banking legislation.</p>

<p>The purpose of these regulations is to confine
the investments of banks to what are called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
liquid securities, but they fail to evince a proper
conception on the part of their authors of what
really makes a security liquid. Apparently
legislators and their advisers have felt that if
the securities held by the banks mature in
short periods, or are listed on a stock exchange,
they are liquid; but such is not necessarily the
case.</p>

<p>Commercial paper only is really liquid, since
it represents a current commercial process
which will soon be completed and the completion
of which automatically provides the
means for its payment. Such paper usually
matures in short periods, but the characteristic
of liquidity results not from the date at which
it is made to mature, but from the commercial
process which called it into existence and will
ultimately retire it. In this country very often
paper of short maturity is so in form only, its
makers expecting to renew it, instead of pay
it, at maturity.</p>

<p>Bonds and stocks, even though they may be
listed on a stock exchange and daily bought
and sold, are not liquid securities in the proper
sense of that term. An individual bank may
be able to sell them in case of need, but such
sale is simply the transfer of the investment to
another bank or person, and not its liquidation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
The security still exists and must be paid, while
its liquidation would take it out of existence.</p>

<p>Foreign legislators have approximated more
closely than ours what is needed in the regulation
of bank investments. In the case of their
central banks, many of them, notably those of
France and Germany, have recognized the fundamental
distinction between commercial and
investment paper, and have required them to
hold the former against their demand obligations,
especially their notes.</p>

<p>The regulation of reserves has become a subject
of legislation in this country only. Our
national banking act classifies national banks
into three groups, called country, reserve city,
and central reserve city banks, and requires
those in the first mentioned group to keep cash
in their vaults to the amount of at least six
per cent of their deposits, and balances in
approved reserve city banks sufficient to bring
the total amount up to fifteen per cent of their
deposits.</p>

<p>Banks in reserve cities are required to keep
in their vaults cash to the amount of at least
twelve and one-half per cent of their deposits,
and balances in central reserve cities sufficient
to bring the total up to twenty-five per cent of
their deposits. Banks in central reserve cities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
are required to keep at least twenty-five per
cent of their deposits in cash in their vaults.
When the reserves of a bank fall to the prescribed
minimum, all discounting must cease.
Regulations essentially similar are found in the
banking laws of most of our states.</p>

<p>The purpose of these regulations is to set a limit to the extent to
which banks may expand the volume of their loans and discounts, in the
belief, apparently, that, if at least the prescribed proportion of
cash is all the time kept on hand, the banks will be able to meet
their obligations. As in the case of the regulations concerning
investments, the authors of these failed to recognize the
significance, from the point of view of the cash demands likely to be
made upon banks, of the kind of paper admitted to discount. If
discounts be confined to commercial paper, the demand obligations they
create will be met for the most part by transfers of credits on the
banks' books or by the return of the notes issued, and, as foreign
experience has demonstrated, the adjustment of cash resources to needs
can safely be left to the judgment of the bankers themselves, who,
through variations in the discount rate, rediscounts, and other means,
can regulate it with ease. If investment paper is admitted to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
discount, reserves less than one hundred per cent of the demand
obligations thereby created are unsafe, since a less amount is likely
to force liquidation on the banks' customers, with the results above
indicated.</p>

<p>The most elaborate regulations for the prevention of inflation have
been developed in connection with legislation concerning note issues.
The reason for this is the fact that commercial banking was at its
origin and for a long time thereafter carried on almost exclusively
through note issues, the conduct of checking accounts being a
comparatively recent development. The phenomenon of inflation was,
therefore, first observed in connection with note issues and
associated with them. Even now the essential similarity of note issues
and checking accounts as banking instrumentalities is not universally
recognized.</p>

<p>The means of safeguarding note issues which have been incorporated
into legislative enactments are the prior lien on assets, the safety
fund, the requirement and sometimes the mortgaging of special assets,
and the limitation of the total issues. By the prior lien is meant the
provision that in case of failure the note holders shall be paid in
full before any of the assets are distributed among other cred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>itors.
By the safety fund is meant a required contribution from each bank,
usually a percentage of the amount of notes issued, placed in the
hands of some public official and kept for the redemption, in case of
failure, of such of the notes of failed banks as cannot be redeemed
out of the assets of the banks themselves. Additional contributions
from the solvent banks are required for the replenishment of the fund
when it has been depleted.</p>

<p>The practice of different countries regarding the requirement of
special assets to be held against note issues, as well as regarding
the mortgaging of such assets, is not the same. Germany and France,
for example, require their banks to cover their note issues by
designated proportions of commercial paper and coin, while the United
States requires its banks of issue to cover their notes by government
bonds and to contribute a five per cent redemption fund in addition,
and England requires the Bank of England to cover a designated amount
of its issues by government and other securities and the remainder by
coin. Unlike the others, the United States mortgages to the note
holders the securities, that is, the government bonds, required to be
held against the notes, by providing that in case of failure these
securi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>ties shall be sold and the proceeds used for the settlement of
their claims.</p>

<p>In all of these provisions, the protection of note holders against
loss in case of failure has been an influential consideration, and in
the cases of the prior lien and the safety fund, the only one. The
prevention of inflation may have entered into consideration in the
other cases, but among the states mentioned the regulations of France
and Germany alone are efficient in this direction, since they alone
prohibit note issues against investment securities. The above
mentioned regulations of England and the United States tend rather to
promote, than to prevent, inflation, since they require the holding of
investment securities against note issues.</p>

<p>The limitation of the aggregate amount of notes that may be issued is
a common legislative regulation. In the United States the limit set is
the amount of the capital stock, and in France it is an arbitrary
figure from time to time changed as the needs of the bank seem to
require. As a safeguard against inflation, the value of such
limitation depends upon the basis of the issues. If it is investment
securities, as in the case of the United States, limitation to a low
figure, not in any case to exceed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> the capital stock, is desirable,
since such limitation keeps the inflation within such bounds that the
banks themselves may be able to withstand the effects of it by selling
upon foreign markets, without great and perhaps without any loss, the
securities in which their capital and surplus funds are invested. If
the basis of issues be commercial paper, such limitation is
unnecessary, since inflation in such a case is improbable, and
pernicious, unless it be placed above the point which the volume of
issues is likely in ordinary cases to reach.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Other Means of Safeguarding the Interests of the
Public.</i>&mdash;Experience has shown that publicity is a valuable safeguard
against bad bank practices, and legislation has, therefore, provided
for it by the requirement that statements of banking operations shall
be published from time to time. The national banking act of the United
States and many of our state banking acts, for example, provide for
the publication five times a year of bank balance sheets, drawn up
according to prescribed forms.</p>

<p>The inspection of banks by public examiners and the requirement of
detailed reports to public officials are also provided for in our
federal and state legislation. Canada requires the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> reports but not
the inspection by public officials, on the ground that the latter
cannot be thorough and efficient, and is, therefore, likely to mislead
the public and cause it to be less vigilant than it otherwise would be
in the use of other means of safeguarding its interests.</p>

<p>Legislation in this country has also concerned itself with the duties
of bank directors and the enforcement of their performance, and with
the relations of bank officers to their banks, particularly those
involved in borrowing for their own uses or for firms or corporations
in which they are interested.</p>

<p>A recent legislative experiment along quite
a new line has been undertaken in this country
in the form of laws providing for the mutual
insurance of depositors. Oklahoma started this
experiment, and her example has been followed
by other states. The essence of the experiment
consists in the provision of a fund out of
which is paid to the depositors of failed banks
that portion of their claims which cannot be
met from the liquidation of the assets of the
defunct banks, such fund to be contributed by
the other banks belonging to the system.</p>

<p>The protection of depositors against loss is
a commendable aim of legislation, but this
method of attaining this aim is open to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
serious objection that it removes from depositors
all concern regarding the proper management
of the bank with which they do business,
and thus gives the unscrupulous, dishonest, and
plunging banker an advantage. Attraction of
depositors is the chief field in which competition
between banks is carried on, and when the
power of good management in this direction is
removed, high rates on deposits, high lines of
credit, low or no rates of exchange, extravagance
in equipment, etc., remain the only attractions,
and in the offer of these the unscrupulous
and plunging banker will always outdo the
conservative.</p>

<p>It is impossible to overcome this objection
by public supervision, and more frequent and
rigid examinations. No public officer can equip
himself to pass judgment on the relations of a
bank with each customer, or to detect secret
contracts and unwritten understandings, or to
keep unscrupulous people out of the banking
business. There can be no doubt that a reputation
for conservatism, good judgment, strict
integrity, and careful management is, at the
present time, the most valuable asset a banker
can have, because customers know that they
are in danger to the extent that these qualities
are lacking. To substitute for the present basis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
of competition between banks that established
by mutual insurance laws is to undermine the
foundations of our credit system and to invite
disaster and ruin.</p>


<h4><i>5. Adequacy and Economy of Service</i></h4>

<p>From the point of view of adequacy and
economy of service, two types of banking systems
require attention; namely, that characterized
by a large number of relatively small local
independent banks, chartered under general
laws, and exemplified in this country; and that
characterized by a relatively small number of
large banks endowed with the privilege of
establishing branches, and exemplified in the
other leading nations of the world.</p>

<p>Under our system each community is encouraged
to look after its own banking needs. Local
initiative in the establishment of new institutions
is given free play and local capital and
local talent is attracted. Outside promoters
and outside capital are not excluded, but, if
they come, they do so as colonists expecting to
cast in their lot with the community and to
become identified with it. The managers of
our banks for the most part are local men who
are the real heads of the institutions they man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>age
and whose careers and prosperity depend
on the success of these institutions.</p>

<p>The localism which characterizes this system
contributes elements both of strength and of
weakness. It develops local talent, and promotes
mutual understanding and cooperation
between the banks and the business enterprises
of the community, and conformity of organization
and methods to local needs. Its weakness
consists in the financial isolation and the narrowness
of vision and training which are its
natural accompaniments. Under this system
capital does not easily and quickly move from
place to place and readily distribute itself
according to the relative needs of different
communities. In consequence, rates of interest
are apt to vary widely, some communities
to be under- and others over-capitalized, and
the capital of the nation as a whole to be
inefficiently employed. Under this system the
opportunity of bankers for training is meager,
since the broader and more fundamental aspects
of the business are rarely brought to their
attention, and in the smaller towns and country
districts they are apt to be recruited from
people of mediocre ability and often from those
not well fitted by nature and education for this
branch of commercial enterprise.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>The system of branch banking, almost universally
employed elsewhere, is strong where
our system is weak, but it has weaknesses of
its own. It promotes distribution of capital
according to relative needs, and consequently
efficiency in the application of a nation's capital
as a whole, and it offers a wide field of training
for the people engaged in the business, and
draws its recruits from every quarter. It can
readily supply banking facilities to communities
too small or too poor to provide for an independent
bank, and more readily than our
system can adjust itself to rapidly growing
communities.</p>

<p>Its chief weakness consists in the lack of
independence of the managers of the branches
and the consequent danger that local needs
may not be fully satisfied. The manager of
a branch is usually granted freedom of action
only in routine matters. Any business out of
the usual order must be referred to higher
authorities connected or associated with the
main office; and, even with the advice of the
manager, who alone is familiar with local conditions,
the decision cannot be made with that
intimacy of knowledge of and sympathy with
the business and aspirations of the individual or
firm under consideration that full justice to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
him and his town may require. In the matter
of adequacy and character of service, therefore,
the city in which the main office is located
has an advantage over those in which the
branches are located.</p>

<p>In this connection it should also be noted
that, while the branch banking system is able
to adjust itself to the capital requirements of
towns of all sizes more readily than the independent
banking system, and thus to secure a
better distribution of the banking capital of
the community, it does not follow that it will
do so. On account of ignorance of conditions,
insufficiency of capital or inability readily to
increase it, or inertia on the part of the head
office, a town may have to wait for the establishment
of a branch longer than it would for
the establishment of an independent bank.</p>

<p>Whether or not this will be the case, however,
depends to a considerable extent upon the
keenness of the competition between the big
banks with branches. The big central banks of
Europe, which have no competition within their
field, have been slow to establish branches.
The coercive force of the government has been
necessary in many cases to secure their proper
expansion. In the case of the other big banks,
however, both of Europe and of Canada, com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>petition
has resulted in very rapid expansion
during the last half century, probably as rapid
as could be desired.</p>

<p>Regarding adequacy of service, the method
of granting charters and the attitude of the
government towards private banking is important.
If banks are allowed to spring up spontaneously,
like manufacturing and commercial
establishments and farms, they are likely to be
plentiful and to be located wherever needed.
Experience, however, has shown that private
banks cannot be adequately regulated in the
interest of the public and that incorporation
under public auspices should be required.</p>

<p>Two methods of incorporation are employed,
those of the special charter and of the general
law. Except in the case of special institutions,
like central banks, the former is objectionable,
since it opens the doors to political favoritism
and is likely to result in bad distribution, lack
of uniformity in regulation, and lack of steadiness
and regularity in development. Incorporation
under general laws, or the free banking
system, as it is sometimes called in this country,
is unquestionably the best from every standpoint.
All the necessary checks and balances
can be incorporated in these laws, and the supervision
of public officers, together with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
necessary administrative machinery, provided
for. This is the only practicable method to
employ in an independent system like ours.</p>

<p>The special charter method works best in
connection with the branch bank system, in
which the question of chartering new institutions
only occasionally arises, and in which
delay is not so serious.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br /><br />

<span class="smcap">Commercial Banking in the United States</span></h2>


<p>The commercial banking system of the
United States consists of several elements
which have been contributed at different periods
in our history. The most important of these
are state banks, national banks, and the independent
treasury system.</p>


<h4><i>1. State Banks</i></h4>

<p>From the very beginning of our national history
institutions enjoying, among others, the
privilege of commercial banking have been
chartered by our states. For several years after
the adoption of our constitution it remained an
open question whether the incorporation of
such institutions was not their exclusive privilege,
but in the case of McCulloch v. Maryland,
in 1819, the Supreme Court decided that the
federal government also had this right.</p>

<p>During the years 1791-1811, and 1816-1836,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
the state banks had as competitors the first and
second United States banks, and in 1863
so-called national banks entered the field, and,
more recently still, trust companies. Private
banks have also existed from the beginning,
but their number and relative importance have
declined in recent years. At the present time
the number of state banks exceeds that of all
other classes of banking institutions combined,
but in capital and resources they are inferior to
both national banks and trust companies.</p>

<p>Since each state has had a free hand in the
matter of legislation concerning the banks chartered
under its auspices, uniformity in the regulations
imposed upon and in the kind and degree
of supervision exercised over this class of
institutions, is lacking. In most cases, however,
as compared to national banks, the amount of
capital required is smaller; they have greater
freedom in the making of loans, especially upon
real estate security; and they are not so carefully
examined and supervised by public officials.
The most frequently imposed legislative
requirements are: the accumulation of a surplus
fund from earnings; double liability of
stockholders; a minimum cash reserve to be
kept in the vaults, and an additional reserve
on deposit in other banks; the organization of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
a banking department for the administration of
the laws pertaining to them; regular reports
and examinations; and some limitation on real
estate holdings and on the amount of loans to
be made on real estate security. On account of
the relatively low capital requirements imposed
upon them, and the liberality of the laws concerning
them in other respects, state banks have
been able to prosper where national banks and
trust companies could not exist, and on this
account in many parts of the South and West
they do most of the banking business in small
towns and country districts. They generally
perform a wide range of banking functions,
including those of investment and savings as
well as of commercial banks.</p>


<h4><i>2. National Banks</i></h4>

<p>Our national banking system owes its existence
to financial exigencies of the federal government
experienced during the Civil War. For
a considerable period preceding the outbreak of
that struggle the expenses of the government
had exceeded its receipts. The deficit was
greatly increased as soon as the war began,
and Congress did not find it possible immediately
to devise adequate new sources of reve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>nue,
including a market for government bonds.
It was, therefore, forced to the issue of legal-tender
notes under authority of an act passed
February 25, 1862.</p>

<p>After three issues of these notes, amounting to $400,000,000, had been
exhausted, and the value of the notes had depreciated to such an
extent that persistence in this method of financiering portended
speedy financial disaster, Congress adopted a suggestion made early in
the war by Secretary Chase, to the effect that a market for government
bonds might be created by compelling banks to purchase them as
security for their note issues. An act passed February 25, 1863,
provided for the incorporation of banks with the right to issue notes
on condition that they purchase government bonds and deposit them with
an official to be known as Comptroller of the Currency.</p>

<p>It was the expectation of the authors of this
act that the state banks, then numbering over
one thousand, would exchange their state for
national charters and purchase bonds sufficient
to secure their circulation under the terms of
the new act, but, since they showed reluctance
so to do, in 1865 force was applied in the form
of a tax of ten per cent on bank notes otherwise
secured. Under this pressure most of the state<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
banks reorganized as national institutions, but
a few retained their state charters and formed
the nucleus of the state system of the present
day. On account of the ten per cent tax, however,
the issue of notes by this remnant became
unprofitable, and the new national banks have
to this day remained the sole banks of issue in
the country.</p>

<p>The act of 1863 has been amended several
times, notably in 1864, 1870, 1874, 1875, 1882,
1887, and 1900. In its present form it permits
the organization of banks with a capitalization
as low as $25,000 in towns of 3,000 inhabitants
or less, and with a capitalization as low as
$50,000 in towns of 6,000 or less. Banks
organized under this act must put ten per cent
of their profits into a surplus fund until said
fund amounts to twenty per cent of the capital;
must invest at least twenty-five per cent
of their capital, if it is less than $200,000, and
at least $50,000, if it is $200,000 or more, in
government bonds; and may deposit said bonds
with the Comptroller of the Currency and
receive circulating notes to the amount of their
par value, provided their market value is par
or above.</p>

<p>The rights and privileges of these banks are
stated in very broad and general terms, a fair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
interpretation of which permits them to engage
in both commercial and investment banking
under certain specified limitations, of which the
most important are the following: they must
not invest in or hold real estate beyond their
owns needs for suitable quarters, or temporarily
for the purpose of collecting debts due
them; they must not accept real estate as security
for loans; they must not loan more than
ten per cent of their capital and surplus to any
one person or firm; and they must keep reserves
to the amount of fifteen per cent of their
deposits, if they belong to the group known
as country banks, and to the amount of twenty-five
per cent of their deposits, if they belong
to either the reserve city or the central reserve
city group.</p>

<p>In the case of country banks, at least two-fifths
of the required reserves, and in the case of
reserve city banks, at least one-half, must consist
of specified forms of money in their own
vaults. The remainder may be balances payable
on demand in approved banks in reserve
or central reserve cities in the case of country
banks, and in the central reserve cities in the
case of reserve city banks. In the case of
banks in central reserve cities, the entire reserve
prescribed by law must consist of money in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
vaults. These required minimum reserves must
not be infringed upon. When a bank's cash
and balances with its reserve agents fall to
the prescribed minimum, discounting must be
stopped under penalty of suspension of privileges
and liquidation by the Comptroller of the
Currency.</p>

<p>At five dates each year, selected by the Comptroller
of the Currency, national banks must
make detailed reports of their condition on
prescribed blanks and publish abstracts of such
reports in local newspapers. They must also
submit to examination by persons appointed for
that purpose by the Comptroller as often as this
official may deem necessary and proper.</p>

<p>National banks have been organized in every
state of the Union, and in Maine, Massachusetts,
and Vermont they have completely
supplanted the state banks. Elsewhere they
exist side by side with state banks and compete
with them. In some states they are more and
in others less numerous than state banks. In
the kind of business transacted the only important
difference between the two classes of
institutions consists in the loans on real estate
security, which national banks are prohibited,
and state banks allowed, to make. The latter,
therefore, share this class of business with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
trust companies only, and where it predominates
have a distinct advantage in competition
over the national institutions.</p>


<h4><i>3. The Independent Treasury System</i></h4>

<p>While not a banking institution, the Treasury
of the United States handles its funds in such
a manner and performs such functions with
reference to the currency that it has become an
important part of the banking system of the
country.</p>

<p>Previous to 1840 the funds of the federal
government were kept on deposit in banking
institutions, during the greater part of the time
in the First and Second United States banks.
Friction between President Jackson and the
Second United States Bank resulted in their
withdrawal from that institution in 1834 and
their deposit in selected state banks, several of
which failed and all of which suspended specie
payments during the crisis of 1837. The embarrassment
which the treasury experienced in
consequence, combined with previous unsatisfactory
relations between the government and
its depositories, convinced President Van Buren
that the Treasurer ought himself to keep and
to disburse the funds of the government. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
made a recommendation to this effect to Congress,
which in accordance therewith enacted
the first independent treasury act in 1840. The
revival of agitation for a third United States
Bank led to the repeal of this act the following
year, but in 1846 it was reenacted and with
modifications has remained upon our statute
books to the present day.</p>

<p>In its original form this act provided for the
acquisition of vaults in certain cities, in which
should be deposited the funds of the government
as soon as possible after they came into
the hands of the receiving officers, and out of
which should be taken, upon drafts issued by
the Secretary of the Treasury, the money
needed for the payment of the government's
obligations. It further provided that all dues
to the government in the future should be paid
either in coin or in currency issued exclusively
by the government, and that all expenses should
be paid in the same forms of money.</p>

<p>Important modifications in this act were
made during and after the Civil War. In 1863
permission was granted the Secretary of the
Treasury to deposit in national banks funds
accumulated in the treasury, and derived from
any source except duties on imports, provided
the banks selected for this purpose should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
deposit with him government bonds for their
security. Subsequently the discretionary power
of the Secretary in this direction was extended
so that at the present time he is authorized at
his discretion to deposit in national banks surplus
funds derived from any source, trust funds
alone excepted, and to accept as security therefor
other securities than government bonds.
Other laws have made national bank notes
acceptable for certain public dues, and have
given the Secretary authority to issue gold and
silver certificates against gold coin and silver
dollars deposited in corresponding amounts,
and to redeem United States notes in gold
coin and to keep on hand for that purpose a
gold reserve of $150,000,000.</p>

<p>In its operation, this independent treasury system affects the
reserves of the banks and through them their discounts and the
commerce of the country. Whenever the receipts of the government
exceed its expenditures, money accumulates in the treasury and the
reserves of the banks are diminished; and, under opposite conditions,
they are increased. The return of accumulated surplus funds to the
banks is possible when the Secretary of the Treasury decides that such
return is desirable or necessary and when the banks are able and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
willing to supply the bonds demanded as security. In case a deposit is
agreed upon the funds go to a relatively small number of national
banks selected as depositories by the Secretary of the Treasury, the
amount allowed each depository also being determined by him.</p>

<p>Through its ability to issue gold and silver certificates, its
obligation to redeem United States notes in gold on demand, its
administration of the United States mints and assay offices and the
laws regulating the supply and distribution of subsidiary coin, the
United States Treasury cooperates with the banks in the supply and
distribution of the circulating medium of the country. The people
apply to the banks for the forms of money and currency desired and
these institutions meet the demand by means of the funds deposited
with them or by their exchange at the various subtreasuries, if the
forms of money deposited do not correspond with these demands.</p>


<h4><i>4. The Interrelations of These Institutions</i></h4>

<p>Under the operation of the national banking
act, New York, Chicago, and St. Louis have
been designated as <i>central reserve</i>, and forty-seven
other cities as <i>reserve</i> cities.  The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
national banks in these reserve cities act as
reserve agents for national banks in the cities
and towns not so designated and ordinarily
receive on deposit the major part of their reserves
plus surplus funds not needed for local
purposes. Banks in the central reserve cities act
as reserve agents for the banks in the reserve
cities as well as for country banks, and on account
of their importance as commercial and investment
centers receive and hold in the form
of bankers' balances a large part of the reserve
funds as well as the surplus investment funds
of the national banks of the entire country.</p>

<p>State banks and trust companies manage
their reserve and surplus investment funds in
substantially the same manner as national
banks, using national banks in the reserve and
central reserve cities as their reserve agents.
State laws usually allow approved state banks
and trust companies also to act as reserve
agents for the banks and trust companies under
their jurisdiction, but these approved banks are
generally located in the reserve and central reserve
cities, and themselves employ the national
banks there located as their reserve agents, thus
forming simply an additional conduit through
which the reserve and surplus investment funds
of state banks and trust companies reach the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
central money reservoirs administered by
national banks in the central reserve cities.</p>

<p>National banks in the reserve and central
reserve cities are also clearing centers for the
enormous volume of checks and drafts which
the administration of the checking accounts of
the banks and trust companies of the country
bring into existence. They act as correspondents
as well as reserve agents for these other
banks and trust companies, and in this capacity
collect out-of-town checks and drafts and conduct
checking accounts for them. Within
these cities, as well as in hundreds of others,
clearing house associations conduct the local
clearings and also act as agencies through
which national and state banks and trust
companies cooperate in the promotion of
common interests.</p>

<p>The center of the entire system is in New
York City. The clearing house association of
that city, consisting of over fifty national and
state banks and trust companies, includes the
banks the vaults of which constitute the central
money reservoir of the country and which
constitute the center of the country's clearing
system. Through the New York subtreasury
pass the greater part of the receipts and disbursements
of the government, and the chief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
assay office in the country is located there. The
New York stock exchange is our only stock
and bond market of national scope, and consequently
the investment center of the country.</p>

<p>The Associated Banks of New York City,
as the members of the clearing house association
are called, hold the greater part of the
reserves of the banks and trust companies not
required by law to be kept in the local vaults,
as well as the greater part of the surplus investment
funds of the entire country. It is through
the operation of the New York subtreasury
on the reserves of the Associated Banks that
the chief influence of the independent treasury
system on the banking business of the country
is exerted, the greater part of the government's
receipts coming directly out of those reserves,
and a large part of the expenditures going into
them, and the greater part of the money deposited
in national banks by the Secretary of
the Treasury going directly or indirectly into
New York institutions. Most of the exports
and imports of coin and bullion pass through
New York, and the major portion of the
foreign exchanges of the entire country are
there effected. The New York Assay Office
receives and distributes the greater part of the
new supplies of gold and silver bullion which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
come from our mines and transforms into bullion
the major part of these metals that come to
us from abroad and do not find employment as
foreign coin. The New York Stock Exchange
is the medium through which a large part of
the surplus savings of the country are invested
in our industries or loaned for the use of our
national, state, municipal, and other local governmental
agencies.</p>


<h4><i>5. Operation of the System</i></h4>

<p>The most noteworthy features of the working
of this machinery may be discussed under
the heads: conflict of functions and laws; loan
operations; treasury operations; reserve system;
absence of elasticity in the currency.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Conflict of Functions and Laws.</i>&mdash;The
two classes of banking institutions which have
been described (state banks and national banks)
and trust companies, described in a subsequent
chapter, exist side by side in many communities,
and in the performance of certain services
compete for the patronage of the public. As
has already been pointed out, state and national
banks differ little in their functions except in
their relation to real estate loans, and in some
states trust companies perform all the func<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>tions
of these institutions and many others
besides. In the performance of these common
services, however, they are rarely regulated by
the same laws or subjected to the same
kind or degree of public supervision. The competition
between them, therefore, is not always
on a fair basis and the temptation to violate
restraining laws and administrative regulations
is strong. The supervising officers recognize
the situation as a rule and go to the extreme
limit of leniency in administering laws and
regulations which operate to the manifest disadvantage
of the institutions over which they
have jurisdiction, but even then it is often impossible
to render the basis of competition fair
and equitable.</p>

<p>This condition of affairs has resulted in the
devising of ways and means of circumventing
obnoxious laws and in some cases in practices
which are pernicious in themselves. As examples
may be mentioned the widespread practice
of national banks, which are prohibited by law
from making loans on real estate security, of
making loans to customers who can offer no
other collateral, on the security of their personal
notes only, or of making loans secured by real
estate by a three cornered operation utilizing
a director or officer or some other third party<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
as intermediary. All three classes of institutions
compete in soliciting the savings deposits
of the community, with the result that the trust
companies and savings banks, which often have
the advantage here, sometimes force upon their
state and national bank competitors a higher
rate of interest on such deposits than they
ought to pay. The differing regulations in
some places in force regarding the amount that
may be loaned to a single individual or firm
has also resulted in some cases in devious and
uncommendable practices.</p>

<p>For the remedy of these conditions the first
desideratum is the careful differentiation of
the various functions performed by all these
institutions, and the devising of appropriate
legal and administrative regulations for each
one. These regulations should then be incorporated
into the legislation and the administrative
practices of the federal government and
of each state, and any institution which performs
any of these functions should be obliged
to submit to the regulations pertaining thereto.
The difficulties in the way of securing such a
differentiation of functions and such community
of action between the federal government
and our states are too obvious to require
statement, but they should not prevent the for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>mulation
of ideal conditions, and a conscious
and persistent effort to attain them.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Loan Operations.</i>&mdash;In making loans, a
typical method of procedure for a business man
is to arrange with a bank for what is technically
called a "line," that is, the maximum
amount he may expect to be able to borrow
under normal conditions. This "line" determined,
he borrows from time to time according
to his needs, giving as security his personal
note, payable in one, two, three, four, or six
months. Sometimes an indorser is required,
and sometimes the deposit of collateral, mortgages
on real estate, bonds, stocks, and warehouse
receipts being the most commonly used
securities employed in such cases. Ordinarily,
when a note falls due, he expects the bank
to renew it, if its payment at the time is
not convenient, the agreement on a "line of
credit" ordinarily carrying with it that implication,
though not legally, probably not morally,
binding the bank so to do. Indeed, the
customer ordinarily counts the amount of his
"line" as a part of his working capital and
expects to keep it in use a large part, if not all,
of the time.</p>

<p>In the determination of the amount of these
"lines of credit," the judgment of some one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
or more bank officers, assisted by a discount
committee and sometimes, though not as a rule,
by a specially organized credit department,
rules. In forming these judgments, the bankers
of the United States as a class are not guided
by any universally recognized and well established
principles. The best ones require from
their customers carefully prepared statements
showing the nature and volume of the business
they transact, and a careful classification of
their assets and liabilities. Others, and these
are a large majority, rely upon the knowledge
they already possess, gained by general observation,
and supplemented by verbal inquiries
made from time to time and by the voluntary
statements of the customers themselves.</p>

<p>The significance of the distinction between commercial and investment
operations in the business of banking is not generally understood, and
is consequently little regarded. The dominant question in the mind of
the average banker, both in determining the amount of a customer's
line and in making loans to him after the line is fixed, is how much
he is "good for," and on this point the total net worth, rather than
the nature of the business operations, of the customer is likely to be
decisive. Of course, the banker is also influenced by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> customer's
reputation for both integrity and business ability.</p>

<p>This method of procedure has the advantage of rendering access of
people to the banks easy and of promoting their extensive use, but it
has the grave disadvantage of opening the doors wide to inflation of
credit. The majority of our bankers do not know whether more or less
than their savings deposits and their capital and surplus, the only
funds which can safely be invested in fixed forms, is so invested. The
promissory notes of their customers, which constitute the major part
of their assets, give no information on this point, and they have not
made the investigations necessary to determine with certainty the
destination of the funds they have loaned. They are satisfied with the
knowledge or the conviction that their loans can be collected, not at
maturity&mdash;they know very well that many, probably most, of them can
not&mdash;but ultimately. The result is that unconsciously and gradually
the banks create their demand obligations in the form of balances on
checking accounts against fixed investments in machinery, buildings,
lands, mines, etc., and, when the payment of these obligations is
demanded, the reserves fall below the danger point and they are forced
to require payment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> at maturity of paper which the maker had counted
upon having renewed indefinitely, and the payment of which is only
possible by the forced sale of the property in which the borrowed
funds were invested, or of some other property in his possession. If
only a single bank or a comparatively few banks find themselves in
this condition, relief may be found in the rediscount of paper with
other banks, in direct loans, or in the sale of securities on the
exchanges; but, if the condition is general, relief by these means is
impossible, and widespread forced liquidation becomes necessary. An
aggravated situation of this kind causes panic and results in a
commercial crisis.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Treasury Operations.</i>&mdash;The operation of our independent
treasury system produces arbitrary fluctuations in the reserves of the
banks and prevents that degree of prevision which is essential to the
most economical and the safest practices. The funds needed for current
purposes are withdrawn from the banks and kept under lock and key in
the treasury vaults, thus diminishing reserves to the extent of their
amount. Surplus funds likewise accumulate in the vaults with the same
result, until the Secretary of the Treasury sees fit to deposit, and
the banks find it possible to receive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> them. Even then the depository
banks alone are directly benefited, and no one of these knows long in
advance how much it is going to receive or when funds left on deposit
will be withdrawn.</p>

<p>Since the volume of the business of the government
is very large, the effects produced by
the movement of its funds are of such magnitude
as to give them national importance, the
ability of banks to loan and to meet obligations
already incurred being profoundly affected
by them. Among these effects must also
be noted the inability of the banks to calculate
these movements in advance, as they to a
degree can those produced by the operations of
their commercial customers, and the relation
between them and the Secretary of the Treasury,
which results. The relation between the
receipts and the disbursements of the government
vary greatly from month to month and
year to year, so that, on the basis of past
experience, it is impossible to predict when the
banks will gain from or lose to the treasury.
The action of the Secretary of the Treasury
regarding deposits of surplus funds is equally
uncertain and unpredictable. No fixed policy
regarding this matter has yet been established
by precedent or determined by law.  Each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
secretary follows his own judgment and is
influenced by current events and conditions.</p>

<p>The uncertainty which results creates a speculative
atmosphere about the money market and
renders the banks dependent upon the secretary
and the secretary influential on the money
market in a manner which is unfortunate for
both. Since they cannot be indifferent to the
operations of the treasury, and cannot predict
them, banks are obliged to speculate regarding
them, and, if they err, they are likely either
to over-extend their credit operations or unduly
to contract them. The former will result when
they expect an increase in their reserves from
treasury sources and do not get it, and the
latter when contemplated withdrawals of funds
do not occur.</p>

<p>The Secretary of the Treasury is not in a
position properly to exercise the power conferred
upon him. He is outside the channels of
commerce and industry, and must, therefore,
secure at second hand the information necessary
for intelligent action. Such sources of
information are frequently unreliable and
inaccurate and their use subjects him to the
charge of favoritism and to the danger of acting
in the interest of special groups or special
localities.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Operation of the Reserve System.</i>&mdash;Each national bank now keeps
locked up in its vaults money to the amount of at least six to
twenty-five per cent of its deposits and a balance with banks in
reserve and central reserve cities sufficient to bring the total to at
least fifteen per cent of deposits in the case of country banks, and
twenty-five per cent of deposits in the case of reserve city banks. In
addition, it is customary for most banks to carry as a secondary
reserve high-grade bonds which can be readily sold in case of need.
The practice of state banks is practically the same as that of
national, and that of trust companies differs only in the amount of
reserves carried and in the proportion between the different items.</p>

<p>This system has many disadvantages. Among them the most obvious,
perhaps, is the withdrawal of enormous sums from the current use of
the agriculture, industry, and commerce of the country. That portion
of these reserve funds which is required to be kept under lock and key
in the vaults, amounting in the aggregate to a billion and a half of
dollars or more, is not available for use in ordinary times, and is
practically useless even in times of stringency, since according to
present law, when the reserves fall to the minimum prescribed by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> law,
banks must stop discounting, under penalty of being put in the hands
of a receiver. The other portions of these funds, namely, those
deposited with banks in reserve cities and those invested in bonds,
are likewise withdrawn from the uses of current commerce, since a
large part of the former is only available for use on the New York
Stock Exchange, and the latter are invested in railroads, mines,
factories, land, etc.</p>

<p>The explanation of the devotion of the redeposited portion of the
reserves to the operations of the New York Stock Exchange is to be
found in the fact that that exchange furnishes a regular market for
call loans on a large scale. Since these funds are held subject to the
call of the banks which deposited them, and interest at the rate of at
least two per cent is paid upon them, the depository banks are bound
to seek investment for them, and call loans on collateral listed on
the exchange under ordinary circumstances are best suited to their
purposes.</p>

<p>Another disadvantage of this reserve system is the dangerous situation
in which it places banks from time to time, and the tendency to panic
which it fosters. The demands made upon banks for both cash and credit
vary with the seasons. In the fall and spring they are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> much greater
than in the winter and summer. They also vary regularly through
periods of years, increasing during the up-grade of a credit cycle and
decreasing for a longer or shorter period after a crisis. Irregular
and unexpected events also cause variations. On account of the
rigidity of this reserve system and the lack of elasticity in our
currency, the means available to banks for meeting increased demands,
especially those of an irregular and unexpected character, are
inadequate, and their employment is often dangerous. These means are:
keeping in the vaults in slack times a large amount of unused cash, a
practice too expensive to be employed; keeping surplus balances with
correspondents at two or three per cent interest, not a sufficiently
remunerative practice to be employed on a sufficiently extensive
scale; rediscount with correspondents of some of their customers'
paper, or loans from them on the security of their own signatures or
on such security supplemented by collateral; and sale of bonds at such
prices as they will bring.</p>

<p>None of these expedients is certain at all times and under all
conditions, and some of them are precarious at all times. Surplus
balances with correspondents are most reliable, but they occasionally
fail on account of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> inability of correspondents to realize upon
their call loans. When calls for the payment of balances are large and
general, it is impossible for brokers whose loans are called by one
bank to transfer them to another. The collateral deposited as security
must, therefore, be offered for sale on the stock exchange, and the
very stringency which resulted in their being so offered renders their
sale, even at slaughter prices, difficult and sometimes impossible.
The result at the best is a heavy fall in the prices of stock-market
securities, and at the worst a stock-market panic and a suspension of
payments by the banks.</p>

<p>Rediscounts and loans from correspondent banks cannot be depended on.
Correspondents are under no obligation to make them. They will usually
do so as a favor, if their condition warrants, otherwise not. Sales of
bonds on the stock exchange are difficult and sometimes impossible in
times of emergency, and are usually attended with loss.</p>

<p>On account of this uncertainty and the danger attending it, when new
and unusual conditions likely to result in increased demands upon them
arise, banks are likely to act "panicky"; to call in their balances
from correspondents; to sell bonds; to call loans; and greatly to
curtail<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> or absolutely to cut off new discounts. This action spreads
the panicky feeling among their customers, and creates such pressure
at the reserve centers as to cause curtailment of accommodations and
panic there.</p>

<p>At the very best, this reserve system is accompanied by high discount
and loan rates and by speculation on the stock market. High rates
result inevitably from the hoarding of currency which it involves, the
supply of loan funds being abnormally diminished, and speculation
follows from the concentration in slack times of funds in New York
City, which can only be employed in call loans on stock-exchange
collateral. Stock brokers regularly take advantage of this situation,
speculate themselves and inspire speculation among their customers.
The mutual dependence of the stock and money markets thus produced by
this reserve system is disadvantageous to both, fluctuations in
values, uncertainty, and irregularity on both being the result.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>Lack of Elasticity in the Currency.</i>&mdash;The money of the United
States consists of four main elements, gold and silver coin, United
States notes, and national bank notes, and none of these fluctuate in
volume in accord with the needs of commerce.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>The gold element depends primarily upon the output of our gold mines
and upon the international movement of gold, increasing when that
output increases and when our imports of gold exceed our exports, and
decreasing under opposite conditions. These fluctuations, however, are
quite independent of our commercial needs. Silver dollars, which
constitute the major part of our silver currency, for several years
have been unchanged in quantity, and the volume of United States notes
has remained at $346,681,016 since the resumption of specie payments,
January 1, 1879.</p>

<p>National bank notes fluctuate in volume as a result of changes in the
number of national banks and in the prices of government bonds.
Whenever a new national bank is organized, a specified portion of its
capital must be invested in government bonds, which bonds are usually
deposited with the Comptroller of the Currency in exchange for notes;
and, when the price of government bonds rises, banks holding more than
the minimum required by law frequently retire a portion of their
circulation in order to recover their bonds for sale at the enhanced
price. When the price of government bonds falls, many banks purchase
additional quantities and increase their circulation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>Changes in the price of government bonds and in the number of national
banks, however, have no connection whatever with changes in our
currency needs, and no more do the fluctuations in the volume of the
currency as a whole, made up of these various elements combined. As a
result of this condition, rates on loans and discounts fluctuate
greatly on account of wide variations between the demand and the
supply of loan funds, and commerce is hampered at certain seasons and
overstimulated at others. As was indicated above, this lack of
elasticity in our currency aggravates the defects of our reserve
system and also aids in the production of financial panics.</p>


<h4><i>6. Plans for Reform</i></h4>

<p>On account of the defects in our system of
banking, there has been long-continued agitation
for reform, increasing in scope and intensity
in recent years. After the crisis of 1907,
which revealed these defects to many persons
who had not observed them before, Congress
appointed a commission to make investigations
and to prepare a reform measure. In January,
1912, this committee submitted a report which
embodied a bill for the incorporation of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
National Reserve Association, to be made up
of a federation of local associations of banks
and trust companies. The purpose of this association
was to supply a market for commercial
paper, an elastic element in the currency, a
place for the deposit of the bank reserves of
the country and of the funds of the government,
as well as proper machinery for the
administration of this market and these funds.</p>

<p>For various reasons, the plan of the monetary
commission did not meet with universal
favor. It was condemned in particular by the
Democratic party, which was victorious at the
polls in the fall elections, and installed a new
administration in Washington, March 4, 1913.
A special session of the new Congress was
called to consider the tariff question, and to it
was submitted another plan for the reform of
our banking system, which was enacted into
law December 23, 1913.</p>

<p>This law provides for the incorporation of
so-called "Federal Reserve Banks," the number
to be not less than eight or more than twelve.
The country is to be divided into as many districts
as there are Federal Reserve Banks, and
the national banks in each district must subscribe
six per cent and pay in three per cent of
their capital and surplus to the capital stock of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
the Federal Reserve Bank located in that district.
State banks and trust companies may
contribute on compliance with the same conditions
as national institutions. If, in the
judgment of the organization committee, the
amount of stock thus subscribed is inadequate,
the public may be asked to subscribe, and as a
last resort stock sufficient to raise the total to
an adequate figure may be sold to the Federal
Government. Cooperation between these Federal
Reserve Banks and a degree of unity in
their administration are provided for through
a Federal Reserve Board of seven members,
two ex officio and five to be especially appointed
by the President of the United States.
For the administration of each Federal Reserve
Bank, a board of directors of nine members is
provided for, six to be appointed by the member
banks and three by the Federal Reserve Board,
one of those three to be designated as Federal
Reserve Agent and to be the intermediary between
the Federal Reserve Board and the bank
of whose directorate he is a member.</p>

<p>The proposed Federal Reserve Banks are to
hold a part of the reserves of member banks
and to rediscount commercial paper, administer
exchange accounts, and conduct clearings for
them. They are also to serve as depositories<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
for the United States government, and to
issue treasury notes obtained from the Federal
Reserve Board in exchange for rediscounted
commercial bills, these notes to be redeemable
on demand by them and to be a first lien on all
their assets. Their retirement, when the need
for them has passed, is provided for by the
requirement that no Federal Reserve Bank shall
pay out any notes except its own, all others
being sent in to the issuing bank or to the
treasury for redemption. Against outstanding
note issues a reserve of at least 40 per cent in
gold must be maintained, and against deposits
one of at least 35 per cent in gold or lawful
money.</p>

<p>This law provides remedies for the chief defects of our system;
namely, a market for commercial paper which will enable a properly
conducted bank at any time, through rediscounts, to secure notes,
legal-tender money, or checking accounts in the amounts needed; a
system of note issues which will fluctuate automatically with the
needs of commerce for hand-to-hand money; a more economical
administration of the reserve funds of the country, unattended by the
dangers of the present system, and an administration of the funds of
the federal government which is free from the evils of the independent
treasury system.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br /><br />

<span class="smcap">Commercial Banking in Other Countries</span></h2>


<p>In contrast with that of the United States,
the characteristic features of the commercial
banking systems of Europe are the central
bank performing important functions for all
other financial institutions and for the government;
a relatively small number of large institutions
with many branches mediating between
the central bank and the people; and the use of
commercial and bank bills instead of promissory
notes as the chief instruments of loans
and discounts.</p>


<h4><i>1. Common Features</i></h4>

<p>The central banks differ considerably in organization and business
methods, but perform essentially the same functions; that is, they act
as financial agents for their respective governments; discount
high-grade commercial and bankers' bills for other banks and
usually for private persons; administer the cash reserves
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
of the entire country; and furnish the greater part and, in some cases,
the entire supply of bank notes.</p>

<p>The other large banks do most of the business with the public, the
central bank's relations being chiefly with them and with the
government. They conduct checking accounts with merchants,
manufacturers, farmers, and others; receive and invest savings
deposits, and deal in certain classes of investment securities;
conduct the domestic and foreign exchanges; discount various kinds of
commercial and banking bills, frequently those not available for
discount at the central bank; and make advances on personal and other
kinds of security. Their main offices are located either in the
central money market of the country or in important financial centers,
and their branches are extended to all places in which banking
facilities are supposed to be needed. As a rule, they are less
restricted by legislative provisions than are the national and state
banks and trust companies of the United States, and are less carefully
supervised and inspected by public officers.</p>

<p>Commercial and bankers' bills are widely used as credit instruments
between buyers and sellers and between bankers and their customers. A
common method of procedure, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> a sale is made on time, is the
drawing of a bill for the amount due, by the seller upon the buyer,
payable at the end of the credit period agreed upon, and accepted by
the buyer, and the discount of the bill by the seller's bank. In
foreign and in some branches of domestic trade, the banker's bill is
used on account of its more general acceptability as an object of
discount, such bills usually being discountable by the central bank
and by banks far distant from the place in which the bill originated.</p>

<p>In case a buyer desires to furnish his creditors with bills of this
kind, he arranges with his banker for a line of "acceptance" credit,
which permits people who sell goods to him to draw bills upon his
banker instead of himself, the banker agreeing to accept the bill and
guaranteeing its payment at maturity. The seller will usually have no
difficulty in discounting such a bill at his own bank, no matter how
far removed it may be from the home of the buyer, the character of the
accepting bank being known throughout the financial world. "Acceptance
lines" are usually granted only on condition that the customer agrees
to supply the bank with the funds necessary for meeting the accepted
bills as they fall due, and to pay a fee for the accommodation. Ample
security<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> that these obligations will be met is usually demanded.</p>


<h4><i>2. The English System</i></h4>

<p>In the English system, the central bank is the
Bank of England, with the possible exception
of a few private banks, the oldest financial
institution in the country. It is privately owned
and privately governed. Its board of directors,
chosen by the stockholders, consists of twenty-four
persons, a portion of whom are practically
life members, being regularly reelected when
their terms of office expire. The others usually
serve alternate years only, vacancies being filled
by promising young men selected from the business
houses of London. The oldest director is
regularly elected to the office of governor of
the Bank, and the next oldest to that of deputy
governor, both serving two years, the deputy
governor regularly succeeding to the office of
governor, and the ex-governors forming the
life members of the board and constituting a
kind of advisory council to the governor, and
known as the Board of Treasury.</p>

<p>The head office of the Bank of England is in
London, and there are eleven branches, two in
London and nine in the provinces. By a law
passed in 1844, the Bank was divided into two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
departments, called respectively the banking and
the issue departments, the latter having exclusive
charge of the issue of notes, and the former
of all other branches of the bank's business.</p>

<p>This same law prescribed the conditions
under which notes could be issued. It provided
that the Bank of England might issue &pound;14,500,000
of notes in exchange for securities, and any
amount in addition in exchange for an equal
amount of coin or bullion. Additions to the
amount issued in exchange for securities might
be made by order of the government to the
extent of two-thirds the amount of issues relinquished
by the other issuing banks, all such
banks in existence at the time the act was passed
being permitted to retain, without increasing,
their existing issues. Most of these other issues
having been abandoned since 1844, the Bank
of England is now permitted to issue in
exchange for securities &pound;18,450,000. The securities
against which these issues are made were
transferred to the issue department by the banking
department, and consist of the debt owed
by the government to the bank and of other
government or governmentally guaranteed securities.
The issue department freely issues additional
notes in exchange for an equal amount
of gold coin or bullion, and on demand redeems<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
notes in gold coin. Since the amount of
notes all the time outstanding greatly exceeds
&pound;18,450,000, the business of the issue department
is confined to the exchange of notes for
gold coin and bullion and the redemption of
notes in gold.</p>

<p>The banking department receives and disburses
the funds of the government, manages
the public debt, and serves as the government's
agent in most of its other financial operations;
receives on deposit from other financial institutions
the money which comes into their possession,
and supplies them with such money funds
as they need from day to day in payment of
checks drawn against their balances; discounts
bills of exchange with a minimum maturity of
four, and in exceptional cases six, months; and
to a limited extent makes advances on and
invests in high-grade public and other securities.
Besides the English government and financial
institutions, it has other customers, but it
is to be presumed that these are of a special
character, since the conditions under which it
does business with private persons are in most
cases more onerous than those prescribed by
other banks, and consequently not attractive to
the ordinary business man.</p>

<p>The so-called English Joint-Stock Banks are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
classified into three groups, known as metropolitan,
metropolitan and provincial, and provincial
banks. The metropolitan banks have
their head offices in London, and do not, as a
rule, extend their branches beyond the suburbs
of the metropolis. The metropolitan and provincial
banks have their head offices in London
and branches scattered throughout the provinces,
as well as in various parts of the city and
suburbs, and the provincial banks have their
head offices in the larger provincial cities, and
each one confines its branches usually to the
town and country districts tributary to the city
in which its head office is situated. Often the
provincial banks establish branches in London.</p>

<p>For banking purposes, these banks are the
chief reliance of the agriculture, industry, and
commerce of the country, but competing with
and supplementing them are the bill brokers
and discount houses, the private banks, and the
foreign and colonial banks. The bill brokers and
discount houses make a business of dealing in
foreign and domestic bills of exchange. They
buy in the first instance a large percentage of
the bills brought to market, keep some of them
until maturity, and sell the remainder to the
other banks, usually indorsing them first. A
large part of the capital employed in their busi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>ness
is obtained by loans made from the other
banks, subject to call and secured by the bills
they purchase deposited as collateral.</p>

<p>The private banks are the remnant left of the
oldest group in the country. There were private
banks in London centuries before the Bank
of England was incorporated, and previous to
1826 the Bank of England was their only competitor.
Since 1844 their number has steadily
diminished. Those which remain have, as a
rule, built up a special constituency, to the special
interests of which they cater. Among them
are strong institutions, but as a class their importance
in the system is not great, and is waning.</p>

<p>The foreign and colonial banks are branches
of important institutions in foreign countries
and the English colonies which have a considerable
volume of business to transact in London.
They serve as intermediaries between their
respective countries and the English money
market, and on account of the enormous volume
of foreign commerce which is financed in London,
their number is large, and the r&ocirc;le they
play on that market is important.</p>

<p>In the operation of this machinery, the most
noteworthy features are the reserve system,
and the administration of the discount rate of
the Bank of England. There is no law on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
English statute books prescribing the amount
of cash which banking or other financial institutions
shall keep in their vaults. The custom
of these institutions regarding that matter is
to keep on hand relatively small sums and to
rely upon the Bank of England or some other
London banking house for the replenishment
of their supply as needed. For this purpose,
London and many provincial banks keep balances
with the Bank of England, and other
banks maintain balances with other London
institutions. These balances may be obtained
by the deposit of coin or Bank of England
notes or by rediscounts. Another widely used
resource is the calling of loans made to bill
brokers or discount houses. Such loans or a
considerable volume of bills of the kind discounted
by the Bank of England, or both, are
regularly carried by London banks and counted
as a part of their reserves.</p>

<p>On account of these practices, surplus cash
not needed in the conduct of the current business
of the country speedily finds its way into
the vaults of the Bank of England, and additional
supplies, when needed, come from this
source. The administration of the cash reserves
of the country thus becomes one of the important
duties of the Bank of England, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
performance of which variation of the rate
charged on discounts is the most important
device.</p>

<p>Many years' experience has enabled the Bank
to determine with a considerable degree of accuracy
the volume of the demands for cash likely
to be made upon it from day to day, and consequently
the amount that it should keep on
hand in the vaults. Whenever this amount
approaches the minimum regarded as consistent
with safety, the directors raise the rate of discount,
and when the amount on hand becomes
excessive, they lower it. The efficiency of this
procedure in increasing the reserves in the one
case and in decreasing them in the other is
due to certain conditions and practices which
deserve attention at this point.</p>

<p>Long-established custom has made the rate
of interest paid on deposits in London and other
parts of England vary with the discount rate of
the Bank, and on this account the market rate
of discount also varies in the same manner.
The Bank of England is thus ordinarily able to
regulate the market for commercial paper. Since
paper payable in London is a favorite form of
investment for continental bankers, by raising
its rate of discount and with it the market rate
above the level of the rates of some or all of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
the continental centers, the Bank of England
is able to induce these bankers to send money to
London for investment and thereby to increase
her reserves, and by lowering its rate below the
level of the rates in these continental centers,
she is able to induce them to sell some of the
paper they already hold, and thus to furnish a
market for her surplus funds and diminish her
reserves.</p>

<p>On account of the readiness with which the
international gold movement responds to variations
in the discount rate of the Bank of England,
the need for an elastic system of bank
note issues is not felt in England to the same
extent as in other countries. It is this fact,
doubtless, which explains the retention to the
present day of the essentially inelastic bank
note system created by the act of 1844.</p>


<h4><i>3. The French System</i></h4>

<p>In France, the Bank of France is the central
institution. It is the oldest of the important
French banks of the present day, having been
established in 1800 by Napoleon the First.
Its capital, amounting at the present time to
182,500,000 francs, or approximately $36,500,000,
is supplied by about 30,000 private<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
stockholders, about 10,000 of whom own only
one share each.</p>

<p>The two hundred largest stockholders appoint
a General Council, consisting of fifteen regents
and three censors. Five regents and all the
censors must be chosen from the commercial
and industrial classes, and three of the remaining
ten regents must be selected from the <i>tresoriers
payeurs g&eacute;n&eacute;reaux</i>, an important group of
representatives of the public treasury scattered
throughout the country. The General Council
as well as the stockholders' assembly is presided
over by a governor, who, together with two
sub-governors, is appointed by the President of
the Republic upon the nomination of the Minister
of Finance. The governor is the chief
executive officer of the bank and the final source
of authority in most matters of vital importance.
He is responsible to the government
rather than to the stockholders, and is subject
to removal only by the power which appointed
him.</p>

<p>The Bank of France has about two hundred
branches and sub-branches located in Paris and
all the important cities and towns in the Republic,
also over three hundred so-called agencies
located in smaller places and transacting only
a limited line of business. Each branch has a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
manager appointed in substantially the same
manner as the governor, and the sub-branches
and agencies are administered through the
branches. Through this network of offices,
every part of the country is brought into direct
and easy access to the Bank.</p>

<p>The Bank of France is the only institution in
the country privileged to issue circulating notes.
The maximum allowed it is regulated by law
and is increased from time to time. At present
it amounts to 5,800,000,000 francs, or approximately
$1,160,000,000. The bank is obliged to
redeem these notes on demand in gold coin or
silver five-franc pieces, but it is free to determine
how much cash it shall keep on hand
for that purpose, and when and under what
conditions it shall issue them.</p>

<p>Its discount operations are limited by law to
bills maturing in not more than three months,
and bearing the signatures of at least three
solvent persons, or two signatures and secured
in addition by specified forms of collateral. It
is also permitted to make loans or advances, as
they are called, on securities of the French
government maturing at fixed dates, gold and
silver bullion, and the money of foreign countries,
and obligations of the French railroads,
French cities, and departments, the Cr&eacute;dit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
Foncier, and the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Algerienne. It is also
obliged to loan 180,000,000 francs ($36,000,000)
to the government without interest.</p>

<p>One of the chief branches of the business of
the Bank of France is the service of the public
treasury and the performance of other financial
duties imposed upon it by the government.
It serves as the depository and disbursing agent
for the government, and performs important
functions connected with the public debt, the
mints, the savings institutions, and publicly
administered trusts of various kinds. It is also
the depository for the banking reserves of the
country. In France, as in England, it is not the
custom of banking and other financial institutions
to hoard money in their vaults, but to
depend upon the Bank of France for supplies
as needed. To this end they keep funds on
deposit there, and regularly rediscount the paper
of their customers when balances need to be
replenished.</p>

<p>Through its network of branches and agencies
spread over the entire country, the Bank
of France is able economically and expeditiously
to conduct the intermunicipal exchanges of
the country. It participates in local clearings
through membership in the clearing houses, at
which balances are paid by checks drawn against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
credits on its books maintained for that purpose
by all members, and it conducts so-called
transfer accounts with other banks and financial
institutions against which drafts can be drawn
payable at any place where one of its offices is
located. Such drafts constitute the chief means
through which transfers of funds are made
between different places.</p>

<p>The business of the Bank of France with
private persons is limited by the requirement
that all paper discounted must have three signatures,
or two signatures and collateral security,
and that advances can only be made on
the security of the forms of collateral indicated
above. Most business men find it either inconvenient
or impossible to comply with these
conditions, and consequently transact most of
their business with other banking institutions.
The third signature on paper discounted by the
Bank is, therefore, usually supplied by these
institutions, which thus act as an intermediary
between the Bank and the commercial world.</p>

<p>Next to the Bank of France, the most important
banking institutions of the country are the
Cr&eacute;dit Foncier, the Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais, the Comptoir
d'Escompte de Paris, the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale,
and the Cr&eacute;dit Industrielle et Commercial. The
Cr&eacute;dit Foncier is principally engaged in extend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>ing
credit based on real estate security, but it
also discounts large amounts of commercial
paper. Its organization is modeled after that
of the Bank of France, and, like that institution,
it is controlled by the state. Since it is
primarily an investment bank, a description of
its principal operations will be deferred to the
next chapter.</p>

<p>The four other banks mentioned are a product
of the commercial life of modern France,
all having been established since the revolution
of 1848. They are all heavily capitalized,
the smallest, the Cr&eacute;dit Industrielle et
Commercial, having a capital of 100,000,000
francs ($20,000,000), and the largest, the
Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale, having a capital of 400,000,000
francs ($80,000,000), and all extend their
business by means of branches. The Cr&eacute;dit
Lyonnais and the Comptoir d'Escompte have
branches in France itself, the French colonies,
and a number of foreign countries; the Soci&eacute;t&eacute;
G&eacute;n&eacute;rale, throughout France, in London, and
San Sebastian, Spain; and the Cr&eacute;dit Industrielle
et Commercial, in Paris and its suburbs.
Taken together, these four institutions supply
the French people in Paris and the Provinces
with banking facilities for both their domestic
and their foreign business. While in some of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
the larger provincial cities local banks with
branches in surrounding towns and sometimes
in Paris are to be found, branches of one or
more of these four institutions are the chief
reliance in nearly all places.</p>

<p>These institutions cater to all the financial
needs of their constituents. They supply their
needs for cash and for exchange; conduct
checking accounts for them, although these are
not used in France to the same extent as in the
United States; discount their commercial paper
and make loans to them on personal and other
security; and receive on deposit their savings
and provide them with investments. In performing
these functions they make extensive
use of the Bank of France and of the stock
exchanges of the country. With the former
they conduct checking and transfer accounts
and rediscount their customers' bills, by these
means procuring the coin, bank notes, and
exchange needed; and from the latter they
obtain the investment securities required for
the satisfaction of both their own and their
customers' needs.</p>

<p>Gold and silver coin and the notes of the
Bank of France constitute the hand-to-hand
money of the country. The latter form the elastic
element, and their operation approximates<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
perfection. When demand for money increases
for any reason, more commercial bills are presented
for discount to the banks, which, after
indorsement, exchange them at the Bank of
France for the notes with which they supply
their customers' needs. The note issues of the
Bank thus expand in direct and immediate
response to the needs of the country for more
currency. When such needs have passed, the
discounted bills, in exchange for which these
notes were issued, mature and are paid in
greater volume than new bills are created and
presented for discount, and notes, or a corresponding
amount of coin, accumulate in the
vaults of the Bank. The notes are cancelled
and destroyed and the coin is kept in store
until it again passes into circulation through
exchange for notes still outstanding, or for
discounted bills.</p>

<p>On account of the elasticity of its note issues, and the extent to
which they are used in the commerce of the country, the Bank of France
has occasion to change its rate of discount less frequently than any
other bank in Europe. The result is that the country enjoys the
advantage of steady and low rates, since in France, as in England, the
discount rate of the central bank controls the market rate, and the
ease and inex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>pensiveness with which the notes are issued make low
rates possible.</p>


<h4><i>4. The German System</i></h4>

<p>The Imperial Bank, with head offices in Berlin, and about one hundred
branches and more than four hundred sub-branches scattered throughout
the country, plays essentially the same r&ocirc;le in the German banking
system that the Bank of England and the Bank of France play in the
English and French systems, respectively. It was established in 1875
by an act which also profoundly affected the entire banking system of
the country, and its development has been aided and directed by
several acts passed subsequently.</p>

<p>Its capital, supplied by the general public, amounts at the present
time to 180,000,000 marks ($45,000,000), and it is governed by three
boards, known respectively as the Curatorium, the Direktorium, and the
Central Ausschuss.</p>

<p>The Curatorium is composed of five members, of which body the
Chancellor of the Empire is ex-officio chairman. A second member is
appointed by the Emperor, and for that position he has always selected
the Prussian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> Minister of Finance, and the three remaining members are
appointed by the Bundesrath. It meets quarterly and reviews all the
operations of the bank. It, or rather, the Chancellor, its chairman,
has supreme power, which, however, he has never exercised except on
one occasion, when he ordered the bank not to accept Russian
securities as collateral for loans, an order since revoked.</p>

<p>The administration of the bank's affairs is chiefly in the hands of
the Direktorium, consisting of a president, vice president, and seven
other persons, all of whom are appointed by the Emperor for life, from
a list of candidates recommended to him by the Bundesrath. This board
selects the staff of bank officers and clerks, and superintends the
daily conduct of the bank's business.</p>

<p>The Central Ausschuss is a committee of fifteen persons elected by and
representing the stockholders. It holds monthly meetings; has the
right to demand complete information concerning the bank's operations,
to discuss all matters freely, and to tender advice and counsel; but
it has no power to control except regarding two matters: it can set a
limit to the amount of securities the bank can purchase, and can veto
any proposed transactions with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> the Imperial Government or with the
governments of any of the states.</p>

<p>Like the other central banks described above, it receives on deposit
and disburses the funds of the Imperial Government; administers the
coin reserves of the country; conducts the domestic exchanges, and
serves as a bankers' bank. It is free to do business with the general
public, but the legal and other limitations under which it must
operate give the other banking institutions of the country the
advantage in competition for this kind of business.</p>

<p>It shares the right of note issue with four other banks, which, out of
thirty-two that retained that privilege at the time the Imperial
banking system was established, alone retain it at the present time.
The issues of these four institutions, however, are relatively small
in volume, and the Imperial Government has the right to deprive them
of it January 1, 1921, or any tenth year thereafter, on condition of
giving one year's notice of its intention so to do. The issues of the
Imperial Bank are subject to the following regulations: they must be
covered by cash and discounted bills maturing in not more than three
months, and signed by at least two solvent persons, the proportion of
cash being not less than one-third of the total.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> If the total amount
issued exceeds the Bank's holdings of gold bullion, specie, and
government notes by more than 750,000,000 marks at the end of March,
June, September, and December, and 555,000,000 marks at other times, a
tax of five per cent per annum is levied on the excess.</p>

<p>The law confers upon the Bank the following powers:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>a. To buy and sell gold and silver coin and
bullion.</p>

<p>b. To discount, buy and sell bills of exchange
whose maturity shall be three months at the longest,
and for which usually three, and in no case less
than two, accredited vouchers shall stand good;
furthermore, to discount, buy and sell bonds of the
Empire or of any German state, or domestic municipal
corporations, provided such bonds mature within
three months at the longest and conform to the new
standards of value.</p>

<p>c. To grant interest-bearing loans for terms no longer than three
months, upon movable security (lombard, or deposit loan business),
such as: gold and silver, coined or uncoined; interest-bearing or
non-transferable bonds maturing within a maximum term of three months,
whether of the Empire, a German state, or of domestic municipal
corporations; interest-bearing non-transferable bonds on which the
interest is guaranteed by the Empire or by any one of the German
states; capital stock and stock priority shares, fully paid up, of
German <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>railway companies in actual operation; mortgage bonds of the
provincial, municipal, or other land credit institutions of Germany
that are subject to state control, including shares of German mortgage
banks to an amount never exceeding three-fourths of their market
value; interest-bearing non-transferable bonds of foreign states, and
foreign railway priority bonds, covered by state security, in amounts
not exceeding 50 per cent of their market value; bills of exchange of
recognized soundness, after deducting at least 5 per cent of their
market value; and pledges of native merchandise, in amounts within
two-thirds of their value.</p>

<p>d. To negotiate collections for the account of individuals,
institutions, and governing boards; and upon security, as before
mentioned, to furnish payments, and make orders or conveyances on the
branch banks or on correspondents.</p>

<p>e. Upon prior security, to buy on behalf of outside parties, effects
of all kinds, including the precious metals; and after delivery to
sell the same.</p>

<p>f. To receive money for circulation or on deposit, with or without
interest, the sum of interest-bearing deposits not to exceed that of
the capital stock and reserve fund.</p>

<p>g. To accept the custody or other management of objects of value.</p></div>

<p>Besides the Imperial Bank there are in Germany eight very large and
powerful banking institutions and a considerable number of smaller and
less powerful ones. The eight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> great ones have each its head office in
Berlin, and connections, through branches, agencies, and controlled
institutions, in other parts of the Empire, the German colonies, and
foreign countries. Together they control about eighty per cent of the
entire banking capital of the Empire. In reality they are federations
of banking institutions, many of which were once independent, and some
of which were promoted and established in the interests of the group.</p>

<p>While these eight institutions are primarily engaged in commercial
banking, they are also promoters on a large scale of German industry
and commerce, both at home and abroad. Through interlocking
directorates, stock ownership, and in other ways, they are closely
allied with the leading industrial and transportation interests of the
Empire, and they have been and are leaders in the promotion of these
interests in other parts of the world, notably in the Orient, South
America, and Africa. They are, therefore, leaders on the stock as well
as the discount markets of the country, and are widely influential in
investment as well as commercial banking affairs.</p>

<p>These, as well as the other commercial banks, consisting for the most
part of local institutions and those catering to special interests,
use<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> the Imperial Bank for rediscounts, for transfers of funds between
different parts of the country, and as a depository for surplus funds.
They do not normally keep on hand more cash than is needed for till
purposes. Being in easy reach of an office of the Imperial Bank,
supplies can be obtained at any time by checks drawn against credit
balances or through rediscounts of commercial bills. Special accounts
are carried for transfer purposes and are used even in the transfer of
funds between different offices of the same institution.</p>

<p>On account of its right to issue notes against commercial securities,
the Imperial Bank has the power to meet the demands made upon it and
to supply the country with an elastic medium of exchange. The levy of
a tax upon the excess of the issues above a prescribed maximum
prevents perfect elasticity, unless this maximum be kept above the
highest point which the circulation would normally reach, since the
actual levy of the tax forces the rate of discount to such a point as
to seriously restrict commercial operations. However, since the line
between commercial and investment banking is not drawn by the great
Berlin banks with the care that is desirable, and since they have been
able at times, especially on account of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> their foreign connections, to
embarrass the Imperial Bank in its efforts to maintain adequate specie
reserves, such a tax is probably a desirable safeguard against
over-expansion of credit.</p>


<h4><i>5. The Canadian System</i></h4>

<p>In important respects the Canadian banking system differs from those
of the European countries which have been described and from that of
the United States. It consists of a varying number of relatively large
institutions, each with several offices administered from a common
center, but without a central bank. For some time the total number has
decreased, since 1900 from thirty-six to twenty-seven, in spite of the
fact that the Canadian law, like that of the United States, provides
for the formation of new banks at any time, on compliance with certain
prescribed conditions, including a subscribed capital of at least
$500,000 and a paid-up capital of at least $250,000. The number of
branches, however, has increased rapidly, much more rapidly than the
population.</p>

<p>The most noteworthy legal provisions pertaining to the banking
business in Canada concern note issues and loans and discounts.
Regarding the establishment of branches, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> amount, and, with one
exception, the composition of the reserves, and many other matters
carefully regulated by law in the United States, Canadian bankers are
left free to follow their own judgment. Neither is there public
examination of banks in Canada. Reports must be regularly made to the
Minister of Finance, and he may call for special reports whenever he
desires so to do; but neither he nor any other public officer has the
right to examine a bank's books or to quiz its officers or directors.
In contrast with banking legislation in the United States, another
peculiar feature of Canadian law is the incorporation of the Canadian
Bankers' Association, an organization resembling in essentials the
American Bankers' Association, and the assignment to it of important
functions connected with the issue of notes and the winding up of the
affairs of failed banks.</p>

<p>Regarding note issues, the chief provisions
of the Canadian law are as follows: Each bank
is permitted at any time to issue circulating
notes to the amount of its capital stock, and
between October 1 and January 1 an additional
amount, equal to fifteen per cent of its combined
capital and surplus, may be issued on payment
of a tax to be assessed by the Governor in
Council, not to exceed five per cent per annum.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
The notes are a first lien on all the assets of
the bank that issued them, and must be redeemed
on demand at the head office and at such other
places as are designated by a committee of public
officials known as the Treasury Board. As
such redemption centers, this board has named
Toronto, Montreal, Halifax, Winnipeg, Victoria,
St. John, and Charlottetown. Each bank
must also deposit with the Minister of Finance
a sum of money equal to five per cent of its
average circulation. The aggregate of the
amounts thus deposited by all the banks is
known as the "circulation redemption fund,"
and may be used in the redemption of the notes
of a failed bank. In case the fund is so used,
and the liquidated assets of the bank prove to
be inadequate for its complete replenishment, a
tax sufficient to meet the deficit is levied on the
solvent banks in proportion to their circulation.</p>

<p>Regarding loans and discounts, the law aims
rather to protect than to restrict the operations
of the banks. They may "deal in, discount,
and lend money, and make advances upon the
security of, and may take as collateral security
for any loans, ... bills of exchange, promissory
notes, and other negotiable securities, or
the stocks, bonds, debentures, and obligations
of municipal and other corporations, whether<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
secured by mortgage or otherwise, or Dominion,
provincial, British, foreign, and other public
securities." The only important restriction
placed upon their loaning activities is the prohibition
of making advances on the security
of landed or other immovable property.</p>

<p>In making loans to wholesale dealers and
shippers of produce, the law safeguards the
banks by allowing them to take a blanket lien
on the goods dealt in by the borrower. This
lien applies not only to the goods in possession
at the date of making the loan, but to any
others which may be substituted for them or
manufactured out of them. This lien is prior
to that of any other unpaid vendor, except one
acquired before the bank's lien was established.</p>

<p>The chief officers of a Canadian bank are
the general manager, the chief accountant, the
superintendent of branches, the inspector, and
the secretary, all connected with the head office,
and the managers of the branches.</p>

<p>The general manager is the chief executive
and the chief in authority. While he is subject
to the board of directors, on account of his
wide experience and knowledge his judgment
is usually followed. The other officers are
appointed by him with the approval of the
board, but, almost without exception, from per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>sons
who have served the bank in subordinate
capacities. The general manager himself is
nearly always a man who has passed through
the hierarchy of positions from the bottom up,
and is therefore thoroughly familiar with every
detail of the bank's business and history. The
inspector has charge of the examination of the
branches, and this work is so carefully and
thoroughly done that examination by public
officials is not considered necessary, or regarded
as desirable by most Canadian bankers.
Regarding this matter, however, there are
differences of opinion, and changes in the near
future are not improbable. The managers of
the branches are in strict subordination to the
authority of the general manager, though they
are necessarily allowed a large amount of discretionary
authority in matters pertaining to
the branch over which they preside. Unless
prevented by distance, they are in daily communication
with the head office or with one
of its representatives.</p>

<p>In the operation of the Canadian system,
noteworthy features are the methods of controlling
credits, of managing the issues and the
reserves, and of securing unity or at least harmony
of action. It is the usual practice in
Canada for a business man to do all his banking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
with one institution. This practice is rendered
possible because most of the banks are large
enough to take proper care of almost any business
establishment in the Dominion, and
because experience has demonstrated its wisdom.</p>

<p>The banks compete vigorously for new
business but do not attempt to attract one
anothers' customers. Indeed a customer who
desires to change his banking connections is
looked upon with suspicion and is subjected to
a very careful examination by the bank that
is asked to take him on, including a careful
discussion of all the aspects of the matter with
the bank he desires to leave. The result of this
practice is that a man's banker is thoroughly
familiar with his affairs, especially his credit
relations, and at the same time feels under obligations
to render him such support and guidance
as he deserves. On account of this
practice, also, commercial paper brokerage
does not flourish in Canada.</p>

<p>The notes of the Canadian banks constitute
practically all of the hand-to-hand money of
the country in denominations above two dollars.
The one and two dollar denominations are supplied
by Dominion notes&mdash;all but $30,000,000
of which are represented by gold coin or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
bullion&mdash;and the lower denominations by subsidiary
silver supplied by the government.</p>

<p>Each bank pays out its notes freely to supply
the cash demands of its customers, and receives
from them on deposit, without hesitation or
depreciation, the notes of other banks as well
as its own. The former, however, are either
sent in for redemption as soon as received or
used in making payments to the banks which
issued them. Thus notes are cleared as readily
as checks and the volume in circulation expands
and contracts in automatic response to business
needs. The fact that these notes are neither
legal tender nor guaranteed by the government
does not interfere with their circulation&mdash;daily
clearings, the first lien on assets, and the
redemption fund amply protecting holders
against the possibility of loss&mdash;but does prevent
their being hoarded as reserves or for any
other purpose and thus contributes towards
their elasticity.</p>

<p>The connection now established by law between
the maximum volume of bank note
issues and the capitalization of the banks renders
necessary the increase of the latter in correspondence
with the expansion of commerce
in order to prevent a contraction of credit.
Present law, however, does not provide for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
such an increase. It is left to the voluntary
action of the banks, which seem inclined to increase
surplus funds rather than capital. The
permission granted in 1908 to extend issues
beyond the amount of capital during the crop
moving season, on payment of a tax, is a makeshift
and not a solution of the difficulty, since
a tax on issues is a means of forcing contraction
of credit and not of adjusting issues to
legitimate needs.</p>

<p>Since Canadian banks are able to meet the
greater part of the public demand for hand-to-hand
money by means of their own notes,
they do not need to carry in their vaults large
amounts of gold and silver coin and Dominion
notes. They keep on hand only so much as
experience indicates they are likely to be called
upon to supply to their customers, plus a
reasonable margin for safety and for the payment
of clearing house balances. The greater
part of their reserves consists of balances in
banks outside of Canada, especially in the
United States and England, call loans in New
York City, and easily salable securities. In
case of an emergency of any kind these resources
may be transformed into gold or their
customers supplied with foreign exchange,
which is often as much or even more needed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
Gold can at any time be exchanged for Dominion
notes if that is the currency wanted.</p>

<p>The lack of a central bank and of a rediscount
market is to a degree compensated
by unity of action among the banks. This is
the result not so much of law as of conditions,
among which the most important are: the fact
that the six largest banks do fifty per cent of
the business and that one of these, the Bank of
Montreal, holds most of the deposits of the
government and is generally spoken of as the
government bank; the fact that the general
managers are experts, in first-hand touch
through their branches with business conditions
in Canada and other parts of the world,
and in possession of the same data concerning
these conditions, and through the same
kind of acquired skill and similar experiences
likely to draw the same or at least similar
conclusions from this data; common interests
in the prosperity of the country and in the
prevention of speculative excesses and mutual
interdependence in the successful conduct of
their everyday business as well as in times
of emergency and stress: and the Bankers'
Association, which through its journal gives
authoritative expression to the best banking
opinion and actually acts for the banks in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
many matters of common interest. To what
extent this community of action takes the
form of rediscounts for each other in ordinary
times it is impossible for an outsider
to say, but that it is operative in times of
stress is indicated by the manner in which the
failures of the Bank of Ontario in 1906 and
the Sovereign Bank in 1908 were handled.</p>

<p>In both of these cases the public was protected
against loss and panic was averted by
the cooperative action of the other banks in
assuming the obligations of these institutions
to the public, and in winding up their affairs in
such a manner as to occasion little disturbance.</p>

<p>While Canadian banks are free to carry on
investment as well as commercial banking
operations, their published reports indicate that
they take care to avoid confusion of the two,
or the infringement of one upon the other.
Their holdings of investment securities are kept
well within the limits set by their aggregate
capital, surplus, and savings funds, and their
method of handling commercial business, based
as it is on accurate knowledge of their customer's
operations and upon the lien upon
produce heretofore described, prevents their
acceptance, through ignorance, of investment
securities under commercial disguise.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br /><br />

<span class="smcap">Investment Banking</span></h2>


<p>In the economy of nations the encouragement and promotion of saving
and the accumulation, distribution, and investment of capital are as
essential as the conduct of exchanges, but the performance of these
functions has not been segregated and institutionalized to the same
extent as has commercial banking. Vast amounts of capital are invested
directly by the people to whom it belongs without the aid of middlemen
and large amounts are also invested through brokers of one kind and
another who can hardly be classed as bankers. The most important types
of institutions which have been developed in connection with these
functions are savings banks, trust companies, bond houses and
investment companies, land banks, and stock exchanges.</p>


<h4><i>1. Saving and Savings Institutions</i></h4>

<p>Saving is an individual matter for which the
essential conditions are the development of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
instinct to make provision against uncertainties
of future income and to better the material
condition of one's self and family, and a surplus
of income above necessary daily expenditures.
In order to secure the realization of
these conditions to as great an extent as possible,
many agencies cooperate in all modern
nations, among them savings institutions. Included
among these are various forms of provident
associations, sometimes independently organized
and sometimes connected with other
organizations, insurance associations of many
kinds, building and loan societies, and savings
banks.</p>

<p>The need for savings institutions varies
greatly among the different nations and among
different classes of people in the same nation.
Among people of great wealth the surplus of
income above expenditures is so great that large
savings can hardly be avoided, and among all
the well-to-do classes the margin from which
savings are possible is sufficiently large and the
desire to save sufficiently great to insure large
accumulations of capital. Among these classes
there is little or no need for institutions designed
primarily for the development of the
saving instinct. What they need are institutions
for the safe keeping, accumulation, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
investment of the savings which they are constantly
making. The principal work of savings
institutions, therefore, pertains to the classes of
people who are not well-to-do and who need
encouragement and help in their efforts to improve
their material condition, if they are so
inclined, and stimulus to make such efforts, if
they are not so inclined.</p>

<p>The means available to savings institutions
for the accomplishment of these ends are the
urging of the importance of saving upon the
attention of people who do not adequately
appreciate it, the placing at their easy disposal
of facilities for making savings when they have
the ability and inclination to save, and the
application of pressure of various kinds to
compel or induce saving.</p>

<p>In the application of these means the
methods employed by the various groups of
institutions mentioned differ widely and they
are efficient in different degrees, partly because
they have other objects in view besides the promotion
of saving and partly because they deal
with different classes of people. Savings banks
constitute the only group to which the term
bank can properly be applied and consequently
the only one to which attention will here be
given.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>In a book entitled, <i>Savings and Savings Institutions</i>, written by
Professor Hamilton of Syracuse University, the following definition is
given:<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Savings banks are institutions established by
public authority, or by private persons, in order to
encourage habits of saving by affording special
security to owners of deposits, and by the payment
of interest to the full extent of the net earnings,
less whatever reserve the management may deem
expedient for a safety fund; and in furtherance of
this purpose bank offices are located at places where
they are calculated to encourage savings among
those persons who most need such encouragement.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Pages 161 and 162.</p></div>

<p>Professor Hamilton classifies these institutions as trustee,
cooperative, municipal, and postal savings banks. In the first group
he places institutions managed by boards of philanthropically inclined
persons who serve without pay; in the second, those managed
cooperatively by the people who make use of them; in the third, those
established and administered by municipalities; and in the fourth,
those connected with the post-office departments of governments. The
strength of trustee savings banks lies in the comparatively low costs
of their administration and in the fact that in their <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>investments
they are likely to enjoy the advantages of the judgment and enthusiasm
of people skilled in the investment business; that of cooperative
savings banks, in their adaptability to the special needs of their
constituents and in the education which cooperative administration
involves; and that of municipal, and especially of postal savings
banks, in their capacity to place their services within the easy reach
of all who need them and in the confidence which their public
character inspires.</p>

<p>In the investment of the funds intrusted to savings banks, safety and
as large returns as are consistent with it, rather than ease of
liquidation, are the prime considerations, and hence they usually take
the form of high grade investment securities rather than of commercial
paper. Their deposits are usually subject to withdrawal only after due
notice, and, being savings deposits, their withdrawal usually follows
only after the lapse of a considerable period of time.</p>

<p>The purpose of their withdrawal is frequently investment and this is
sometimes made through the agency of the bank which held the deposit
and may involve merely a transfer of securities.</p>

<p>Outside of the New England and middle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
states, savings banks were rare in this country
previous to the inauguration of our postal savings
bank system in 1911. The explanation of
this condition is doubtless to be found chiefly
in the wide extension of private, state, and
national banks, and trust companies, practically
all of which conduct savings departments and
solicit the patronage of savers. These institutions
have coveted this field and have not
encouraged the establishment of savings banks.
There is reason to believe, however, that they
have not worked the field as thoroughly as savings
banks would have done and that, on
account of the dominance of their other interests,
they are not as well fitted as savings banks
to work the field thoroughly. Moreover it is
probable that they are not able to pay as high
a rate on deposits as well conducted savings
banks would be able to pay. There seems,
therefore, to be room, and probably need, here
for the development of savings banks of some
at least, if not all, of the types above described.</p>


<h4><i>2. Trust Companies</i></h4>

<p>Within a comparatively short period of time
the trust company has developed into an institution
of prime importance in the United<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
States. In the beginning of its history it was,
as its name implies, simply an institution for
the administration of trusts of various kinds,
such as the execution of wills, the guardianship
of minors and other dependent persons, the
administration of the estates of persons either
unable or unwilling to administer them for
themselves, and trusteeship under corporate
mortgages, especially those of railroads. In
the latter capacity they became mortgagees in
trust for bondholders, registering the bonds,
collecting the interest as it became due, paying
the bonds at maturity, and in case of default
taking the legal steps which were necessary for
the protection of the bondholders.</p>

<p>The execution of these trusts involved in
most cases the custody and investment of
funds, so that investment banking became a
part of their business almost from the beginning,
and, in time, in states in which the laws
passed for their regulation did not prevent, they
added commercial banking to their other functions.
In some cases they have also become
promoters of enterprises, taking the initiative
in the organization of corporations for various
industrial and commercial purposes. In New
York City, and in individual cases in some
other large cities, the commercial end of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
business has become the dominant one; in the
former case on account of the ability of these
companies, unrestricted by certain laws applying
to state and national banks, to offer to commercial
customers better terms than their
competitors. In most states, however, especially
in the large cities in which they chiefly flourish,
trust companies have become primarily investment
banking institutions, their other functions
being carried on as side lines and assuming, of
course, in some cases greater importance than
in others.</p>

<p>Since they are still in the early stages of
their development, the status of trust companies
in the banking system of the United States is
not yet definitely determined. Legislation concerning
them varies considerably in different
states, as do also their relations with other
banking institutions. The competitive character
of these relations has resulted in some
cases in legislation which has aimed to differentiate
and define the various functions which
all these institutions perform, and to prescribe
the conditions under which each one or each
group must be performed, regardless of the
way in which they are combined, and in others,
in their practical consolidation with national or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
state banks, or both, through community of
stock ownership, interlocking directorates, etc.</p>

<p>From the point of view of the convenience
of the public there are advantages in the combination
of all the banking functions in a single
institution, and the success of trust companies
to some extent has been due to this cause, but
they have also profited from the unequal competition
which exemption from certain limitations
imposed on state and national banks has
enabled them to enjoy. The removal of the
conditions which result in this unequal competition,
a process already in progress and
likely to continue to completion, will reveal the
strength of the advantages of combination
versus specialization of functions. Previous to
such a revelation it will be impossible to determine
whether or not the trust company form
of organization is destined to become the dominant
one.</p>


<h4><i>3. Bond Houses and Investment Companies</i></h4>

<p>A large part of the business of investment
banking in the United States is conducted by
corporations and firms organized for the purpose
of buying and selling investment securities,
especially bonds and mortgages. Rarely, if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
ever, do these concerns conduct savings
accounts. Ordinarily they confine their attention
exclusively to the investment end of the
business and act in the capacity of jobbers, or
brokers, or both.</p>

<p>Within the investment field some of them
specialize closely and others deal in a wide
range of securities. The specialties most frequently
followed are government, state, and
municipal bonds, railroad bonds, public service
securities, timber bonds, irrigation bonds, and
real estate mortgages. Specialization involves
the development of expert knowledge of the
class of securities dealt in and thus of special
serviceableness to both investors and the promoters
of the enterprises or the public bodies
which issue the securities. These specialists
sometimes serve as middlemen between the
issuers of securities and other investment
banks, as well as between them and the real
owners of the capital invested, their expert
knowledge being of service to the former as
well as the latter.</p>

<p>Until recently there have been few attempts
to regulate the operation of these institutions
by law, but the fraudulent practices of some
of them, and the ignorance and weakness of
perhaps the majority of investors, have recently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
created in some quarters a strong public sentiment
in favor of such regulation. In several
states legislation has resulted, of which the most
noteworthy is the so-called "blue sky laws" of
Kansas and some other states.</p>

<p>In details these laws differ widely from one
another, but they are alike in that they impose
upon some branch of the state government the
obligation of supervising both companies which
issue securities and those which offer securities
for sale. The Kansas law, the first of this kind
passed in the United States, has been considered
too drastic by most of the companies that
have attempted to operate under it, but the
Wisconsin law, which went into effect October
1, 1913, is looked upon with more favor.</p>

<p>In formulating these and other laws for the
proper regulation of these concerns, it has
been found difficult to provide adequate protection
to the investing public without unduly
hampering the issue and negotiation of securities,
but this difficulty should, and in time
doubtless will, be overcome. A free and open
market for bonds, stocks, and other evidences
of indebtedness is essential to freedom of enterprise
and mobility of capital, which are in turn
essential to the economic prosperity of any
country. On the other hand, investors undoubt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>edly
need and deserve the protection of the
state against misrepresentation and fraud. It
is practically impossible for them in many,
perhaps in most, cases to obtain the information
necessary for self-protection. The matters
and conditions to be dealt with in such legislation
are so complex and subject to such frequent
change that laws are apt to be imperfect,
inefficient, or obstructive. It seems probable
that those which do not attempt to be specific
and detailed, but give wide powers and discretion
to administrative boards or commissions,
are most likely to be successful.</p>


<h4><i>4. Land Banks</i></h4>

<p>In Europe an important group of institutions
has developed for the supplying of agriculture
and the building industries with the capital
needed in their operations. The greatest number
and variety of these are in Germany, in
which their development has been continuous
since the days of Frederick the Great.</p>

<p>In order to assist in the recuperation of his
kingdom from the devastation caused by the
Seven Years' War, Frederick caused the land
owners of certain provinces to be organized
into associations called Landschaften, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
were authorized to issue mortgage bonds on the
joint security of the lands of all the members
of the association in exchange for mortgages
on the lands of individual members who needed
funds for the improvement of their estates.
These mortgages were made payable to the
association in the form of small annuities, to
which were added the interest paid on the
bonds and an increment for the payment of the
expenses of the association.</p>

<p>These associations were governed by the
members through a general assembly, representative
boards, and elected officers, and were
supervised by the state and carefully regulated
by law. Regulations were carefully worked out
pertaining to the ratio that the loan should
bear to the value of the estate mortgaged,
methods of valuation, ways and means of
maintaining an equilibrium between the bonds
issued and the mortgages held, the treatment
of defaulting members, etc., etc. Machinery
for the sale of the mortgage bonds delivered
to members was also created, and in some cases
later on these sales were made directly by the
associations themselves, and cash paid to the
maker of the mortgages.</p>

<p>Five of these original Landschaften have
continued to the present day, and others<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
modeled after them were subsequently established.
In 1909 in all Germany twenty-five
were in operation, of which eighteen were in
Prussia. The newer ones have not in all
respects followed their models. Unlike the
original five, membership in them is not limited
to the nobility and is not compulsory; the
liability of the members for the payment of the
bonds issued has in some cases been limited
to a percentage of the total; the loans are
usually paid in cash; and the bonds are sold
directly by the associations; but the principles
of mutual liability and mutual control which
were basic in the old organizations have not
been violated in any case. Both old and new
are organized in the interests of borrowers on
real estate mortgage security, and aim to secure
funds for these on the lowest possible terms
and for long periods of time, by making the
security offered the lenders greater than any
single borrower could supply.</p>

<p>The degree of their success is indicated by
the fact that in 1909 the amount of their outstanding
mortgage loans amounted to nearly a
billion dollars, and that their mortgage bonds
rank on the exchanges with Prussian state
bonds and have at times outranked them.</p>

<p>Another type of land bank appeared in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
early part of the nineteenth century as a result
of the movement for the freeing of the serfs
and their transformation into freehold peasants.
The lands of these cultivators were burdened
with a variety of feudal dues and charges
which had to be commuted before they could
become freeholds. In order to facilitate this
process banks were established which assumed
the obligations of a peasant towards his feudal
superior in return for a mortgage on his holding,
repayable with interest in the form of an
annuity, and in amount equal to the sum to
be paid to the feudal superior for the total
extinguishment of all feudal obligations.</p>

<p>Some of these banks were established and
administered by states, provinces, and communes,
and some by private parties. The public
ones obtained the funds they needed partly
from subsidies and partly from the sale of
guaranteed mortgage bonds and the private
ones wholly from the sale of mortgage bonds.</p>

<p>The completion of the work for which these banks were originally
established put an end to their development about 1883, but similar
institutions have since been established in Prussia to assist
colonists in the purchase and equipment of their farms, and in central
and western Germany to promote general agricultural and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> urban real
estate operations. The colonists sent into Poland for the
Germanization of that province were in this way assisted by the
Prussian government, and in some parts of Germany the same means have
been employed for the purpose of aiding in the process of breaking up
large estates into small holdings, in the construction of dikes,
roads, and reservoirs, and in changing the courses of streams.</p>

<p>Next to the Landschaften the most important
intermediaries between capitalists and investors
in real estate in Germany are the so-called
Hypothekenaktienbanken, or joint-stock mortgage
banks. These are private corporations,
capitalized by the sale of stock shares to the
general public, and controlled by their stockholders
through directorates, like industrial
corporations the world over. Their business is
the making of long-period loans on real estate
security, and the funds thus employed are
obtained by the sale of mortgage bonds secured
by the real estate mortgages in which the proceeds
are invested and by their own capital,
surplus, and other funds.</p>

<p>They differ from the Landschaften in that
they are not cooperative or mutual institutions,
but strictly business enterprises run in the
interests of their stockholders. Their primary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
aim is to earn dividends rather than to secure
the lowest possible loan rates and other favorable
terms for borrowers. As a matter of fact
they are forced by competition and by the
principles of good business to make loans at
reasonable rates and on favorable terms regarding
repayment and other matters, and they
successfully compete with the Landschaften
and other cooperative credit institutions of Germany.
Their mortgage loans are usually made
repayable on the annuity plan, one-half per
cent each year being the common rate of payment,
and they loan about the same percentage
of the value of the lands mortgaged, as do the
Landschaften and other land banks, and the
rate of interest charged is the market rate,
into the determination of which, of course,
the competition of all other institutions enter.</p>

<p>While these institutions loan in the aggregate
enormous sums on farm property, their
chief field of operations is urban real estate,
and particularly the industry of residence, or
as we would call it in this country, apartment-house
construction. It is on this account that
the period of their most rapid development
coincides with that of the recent rapid industrial
and commercial development of Germany,
which dates back only to the establishment of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
the Empire in 1870. Most of them began
operations in the decade 1862-1872, but the
most rapid growth in the magnitude and scope
of their business operations has come in recent
years.</p>

<p>In 1899 there were forty institutions of this
kind in operation in the German Empire. The
number at the present time is probably considerably
greater, since for obvious reasons combinations
among them are not promoted by the
same kind of economic pressure that in recent
years has operated so efficiently in Germany in
the field of commercial banking.</p>

<p>Two other groups of German institutions
merit attention in this connection, namely, the
so-called Schulze-Delitzsch and the Raiffeisen
Credit Associations.</p>

<p>The Schulze-Delitzsch societies were the
direct outcome of the period of dearth and
famine through which Germany passed in the
years immediately preceding the revolution of
1848. The first one was not a credit association,
but a cooperative buying society, organized
by a local judge named Schulze for the
aid of his needy neighbors of the small trading
class in the town of Delitzsch. In 1850 a credit
association on the same plan was organized.
Others followed, in rapid succession in and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
after the seventies, until at the present time
they are numbered by the thousands and their
members by millions, and they are scattered
throughout the entire empire.</p>

<p>The principle of their organization is the
association of a comparatively small group of
neighbors, or of people who know one another
well, or who may easily come to know one another
well, by each making a contribution to a
common fund to be loaned out to individuals
on personal security chiefly, and which,
together with the credit of the entire group,
may be made the basis of security for larger
funds to be borrowed on the open market. They
are carefully organized on the cooperative
principle, each member having an equal voice
in a general assembly which chooses a board of
directors and a small administrative board, to
which is intrusted the actual management and
administration of the affairs of the society.</p>

<p>Loans are made to members only, usually
for short periods of time, on the personal
security of the borrower and of others who
are willing to vouch for him, and on the unusually
favorable terms which the credit of the
entire organization and very low costs of
administration render possible. The knowledge
which each member has of the character<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
and business methods of his fellow members
who borrow, and of the use to which borrowed
funds are put, and the stake which each one
has in the financial stability and success of the
organization, bring the percentage of losses to
a very low figure, and make it possible for
these societies to grant their members maximum
accommodations at minimum prices.</p>

<p>To the funds accumulated from initiation
fees, membership dues and the sale of the associations'
credit have been added, in constantly
increasing amounts in recent years, the savings
of the members themselves. Many societies
have such an amount of funds intrusted to
them in this way that they are not only entirely
freed from the necessity of borrowing, but are
obliged to seek opportunities for investment
outside their own group.</p>

<p>This condition of affairs, in addition to many
other common interests, led to the federation
of the Schulze-Delitzsch societies into larger
groups, and these in turn into state and national
associations, through which surplus funds in
one could be made to serve the needs of
others inadequately supplied, and through
which all the societies could be brought into
efficient connection with the general money
market of the country. For a number of years<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
these federated societies conducted a large central
institution, first in Frankfurt and afterwards
in Berlin, known as the Deutsche
Genossenschaftsbank. In 1904, however, this
institution was absorbed by the Dresdener
Bank, one of the eight great private banking
corporations of Germany, which now serves as
the central agency for all these societies.</p>

<p>The membership of these associations is not
restricted to any class of persons, and they
actually include a very large number of small
farmers. An inquiry made in 1885 showed
that in 545 of them, with a total membership
of 270,808, there were 72,994 farmers, and that
one-fifth of the total loans of these associations
were made to this class of their members. They
must, therefore, be numbered among the land
banks of the Empire, or at least among the
institutions which are helping to solve the credit
problem for the agricultural classes.</p>

<p>The Raiffeisen societies resemble the
Schulze-Delitzsch in many particulars and
differ from them in others. Like them they are
strictly cooperative in character, and, when
organized for credit purposes, designed to
supply members with loans on the most favorable
possible terms. Their development was
also due to the hard economic conditions of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
the period immediately succeeding the revolution
in 1848.</p>

<p>They differ from the Schulze-Delitzsch societies
chiefly in the following particulars:
They charge no initiation fees and do not
rely to the same extent on the proceeds of
the sale of shares, the amount of which they
place at a very low figure, often the lowest
permitted by law; they make long-period as
well as short-period loans, indeed the former
chiefly; they do not pay dividends on their
share capital, but instead put all profits into
reserve funds or prevent their accumulation
by keeping the loan rates low; they exercise
more care than do the Schulze-Delitzsch
associations to keep their societies small, laying
great emphasis upon the importance of personal
acquaintance between members and thus
upon mutual watchfulness; and, in their origin,
they were peasant organizations pure and
simple, and hence more strictly land banks.</p>

<p>Their founder, F. W. Raiffeisen, Burgomeister
of a small village in Westphalia,
Prussia, wanted to rescue the poor peasants of
his and other districts from the clutches of the
usurers, into whose hands they had fallen and
by whom they were being exploited in a most
shameful manner. Since it was loans that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
these people needed and since their cash resources
were always very low and in many
cases nil, he felt that to require, as a condition
of membership, entrance fees and the purchase
of one or more shares of stock, however small,
would be fatal to the success of his plans. He
also firmly believed that in the integrity, industry,
frugality, and agricultural skill of these
people was the basis for sound credit and that
cooperation was a means by which these elements
of sound credit could be made available
and attractive on the money market. At the
beginning, therefore, no entrance fees or share
subscriptions were required. Later Prussian
law made share subscriptions compulsory and
they were, of course, introduced, but they were
made so low, and the acquisition of the money
for their purchase so easy, that they have not
been a serious obstacle.</p>

<p>From the beginning Raiffeisen invited to
membership in his societies the well-to-do and
substantial people as well as peasants. Of
course these people did not require the society
for the satisfaction of their own credit needs,
but Raiffeisen saw that they would greatly
strengthen the credit of the societies and he
was able to appeal to them on philanthropic
grounds. This class of people have a leading<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
part in the administration of the societies of
which they are members and have contributed
greatly to their success.</p>

<p>At the outset the Raiffeisen societies had to
rely chiefly on borrowing for the acquisition
of the capital needed, but with time and success
savings deposits, surplus funds accumulated
out of profits, and lastly the proceeds of
the sale of shares have played an increasing
r&ocirc;le. At the present time many societies are
not obliged to borrow at all, and not a few
have surplus funds which are placed at the disposition
of other societies which are still
obliged to borrow.</p>

<p>Like the Schulze-Delitzsch societies the Raiffeisen associations have
federated. At present there are thirteen so-called unions, and at the
head of all is a central bank with head office at Berlin and branches
at K&ouml;nigsberg, Danzig, Breslau, Cassel, Frankfurt, Coblenz, Brunzwick,
Strassburg, Nuremberg, Posen, and Ludwigshafen. The central bank is a
joint-stock company, organized on the principle of limited liability,
the stock of which is owned by the local societies. It formerly had
close relations with the Imperial Bank, but is now associated with the
so-called Centralgenossenschaftskassa, endowed by the state of
Prussia,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> in such a way that advances and discounts are extended to it
on favorable terms.</p>

<p>The Raiffeisen societies rival the Schulze-Delitzsch
in the rapidity of their growth and
in the r&ocirc;le they play in the economic life of
modern Germany. In 1908 they numbered
5,047, of which 4,340 were credit associations.
The collective balance sheets of these societies
in 1907 showed 490,734,834 marks assets,
489,234,357 marks liabilities, and a membership
of 405,819.</p>

<p>While Germany was the pioneer in the establishment
of land credit institutions, and while
such institutions have attained a greater variety
of form and a higher degree of perfection in
that country than in any other, other countries
have advanced along similar lines and now
have institutions and a fund of experience well
worthy of study. The institutions of Germany
have in most cases served as models in these
other countries, the mortgage banks and the
Schulze-Delitzsch and Raiffeisen societies having
been most frequently copied. These models
have been adapted to foreign conditions and
modified in interesting and instructive ways as
well as copied without essential change.</p>

<p>Among the mortgage banks developed outside
of Germany the Cr&eacute;dit Foncier of France<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
is especially noteworthy. In its organization it
was modeled after the Bank of France and is
second only to that institution in the magnitude
of its operations and the scope of its influence.
Its head office is in Paris and it has
at least one branch in each department. Its
capital stock owned by private parties amounts
to about $40,000,000, its surplus to over $4,000,000,
its loans secured by mortgage to over
$400,000,000, and its total resources to about
$1,000,000,000.</p>

<p>Like the German mortgage banks, it secures
the greater part of its loan funds through the
issue of mortgage bonds and a large percentage
of its loans are made on mortgage security for
long periods of time and are repayable on the
annuity plan. However, it transacts a greater
variety of business than does the typical mortgage
bank of Germany. It loans on city and
farm real estate and to communes, and it
transacts a large commercial banking business,
though this is distinctly a side issue, incorporated
with its other business in order to give
profitable employment to funds, sometimes
large in amount, which are temporarily on hand
awaiting investment.</p>

<p>At various times it has absorbed competing
institutions and at times it has established<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
collateral institutions to transact lines of business
for which its own constitution and legal
limitations did not fit it. Among these the most
important are the Cr&eacute;dit Agricole and the Foncier
Algierienne. It was obliged ultimately to
absorb and liquidate the former, but the latter
still flourishes in the colony of Algiers.</p>

<p>Mortgage banks have also gained a footing
in most of the other countries of continental
Europe. In Italy they passed through a period
of storm and stress, owing to their connection
with the issue banks of that country and the
consequent confusion between commercial and
investment banking which resulted, but they
have recently been established on an independent
basis and are now developing along right
lines and with apparent success.</p>

<p>The Schulze-Delitzsch and Raiffeisen societies
have been imitated in Austria, Hungary,
Belgium, Switzerland, and, to some extent, in
France and India. The so-called "Banche
Populari" and "Casse Rurali" of Italy are
respectively modified forms of these two German
types, and rank among the most important
means employed in that country for the improvement
of the condition of the peasants and
small tradesmen. State, provincial, and communal
aid for these institutions has been more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
frequently evoked and more extensively employed
outside than inside of Germany, and
other important modifications of the German
prototypes have been made in Italy and elsewhere.</p>


<h4><i>5. Stock Exchanges</i></h4>

<p>An essential part of the machinery of investment
banking is the stock exchange. This is a
place where the buyers and sellers of securities
or their agents regularly meet for the transaction
of business. It may be a portion of a street
or a market place or a room in a building. A
fully equipped modern exchange contains a
large room equipped with telegraphic and telephonic
communication with the most important
parts of the country in which it is located and
of the world, with apparatus for registering
prices and easily communicating information
to its members, and with the offices needed for
the accommodation of the clerks and other
employees required. Either by posts or in some
other manner the precise places in it in which
each security or group of securities is to be
dealt in is also usually indicated.</p>

<p>The purpose of the stock exchange is to
facilitate and to regulate dealings in securities.
It facilitates such dealings by providing as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
nearly perfect means as is possible for putting
buyers and sellers into communication with
each other, and for collecting and making available
to them the information they need. To
this end they provide for daily meetings at
fixed hours; they make and publish lists of the
securities dealt in; they speedily record and,
through the telegraph and the telephone, communicate
to all quarters of the globe the prices
at which securities change hands; and through
the meeting room equipped as before described
they make it possible for buyers and sellers,
no matter where located, to communicate with
each other in a very short period to time. They
regulate such dealings by establishing and
rigidly enforcing rules and regulations for listing,
transferring, clearing, and paying for
securities and for other matters pertaining to
the conduct of their members.</p>

<p>These institutions serve investment banks as
well as private investors, constituting the
machinery which connects them all. They thus
enlarge the area and scope of the markets for
securities, and greatly increase the mobility of
capital. Without them the surplus savings of
one locality would only very slowly and with
difficulty find their way to other localities where
they are needed, with the result that capital<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
would lie idle or be very inefficiently employed
in some places while in others natural and
human resources would be undeveloped or very
inefficiently developed.</p>

<p>Existing stock exchanges differ considerably
in the manner in which they are organized and
managed, in methods of doing business, and in
the scope of their operations. Some of them
are incorporated and others unincorporated;
some restrict their membership to a prescribed
number, others admit as many as are able and
willing to comply with the conditions imposed;
some are local in their scope, some national, and
others international. In this country all the
exchanges deal in local securities chiefly, except
the one in New York City, which is national in
its scope. The London exchange does a larger
business in international securities than any
other, but the Paris and Berlin exchanges, as
well as those located at the other important
European capitals, and the one at New York
share in it to a greater or less degree.</p>

<p>Stock exchanges have suffered in reputation,
and their real functions and merits have been
obscured by the abuses to which they have been
subjected. Connected with their legitimate
business of facilitating the investment of capital,
various forms of speculation have developed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
which in some cases have degenerated into
gambling pure and simple. The better managed
ones have striven to rid themselves of
these abuses, and in some countries, notably in
Germany, legislative bodies have taken a hand.
The results, however, have proved only partially
successful.</p>

<p>Some forms of speculation are not only legitimate but necessary in
modern business life, and these shade into the illegitimate,
unnecessary, and positively harmful forms by such short and easy steps
as to render it difficult, and perhaps impossible, to draw a line
between the two which can serve as a guide for regulations of an
administrative or legislative kind.</p>


<h4><i>6. Some Defects in Our Investment Banking Machinery</i></h4>

<p>A comparison of our investment banking
machinery with that of European countries,
especially Germany, reveals important differences.
Among these the most notable are the
wide use there and the almost complete absence
here of the following: (a) the resort to cooperation
as a means of revealing and making available
the basis for credit of large numbers of
people who lack capital but could use it to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
advantage of themselves and of the nation;
(b) the long-period mortgage loan repayable
on the annuity plan and the mortgage bond as
a means of accumulating capital for such loans;
and (c) the cooperation of the state and other
public bodies and of capitalists and philanthropically
disposed persons in developing the
credit possibilities of the masses and in directing
the flow of proper portions of the stream
of capital in their direction.</p>

<p>In the development of investment banking
institutions in this country, individual initiative
prompted by self-interest has been the chief,
and except in the case of savings banks, the sole
motive force. The result is that most of them
have been organized in the interests of lenders
rather than borrowers and serve best the purposes
of big business and of persons already
possessed of large credit by virtue of their
wealth or their business reputations. Under
these conditions, while enormous amounts of
capital in the aggregate have been invested in
agriculture and urban real estate, the former
has suffered relatively in comparison with
transportation, manufacturing, and speculation.</p>

<p>Contributory causes in the development of
this situation have been the great need for capital
for the development of our transportation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
system, the stimulation of manufactures by
high protective duties, and the enormous area
of our public domain which was given or sold
to settlers on very easy terms. Inasmuch as our
transportation system and our manufacturing
industries have now attained a high degree
of development, our public domain has been
nearly exhausted, and land values and the cost
of living are rapidly rising, the needs of agriculture
are pushing themselves into the foreground,
and we are beginning to look to European
experience for suggestions regarding the
best methods of diverting to that industry a
larger part of our rapidly accumulating capital
resources.</p>

<p>There are obvious difficulties in the way of
the application of cooperation to the solution
of the problem of agricultural credit in this
country. In spite of the fact that immigration
is constantly bringing to us people from the
very foreign countries in which cooperative
credit associations flourish, our agricultural
population is still dominated by the spirit of
individualism which has been and is one of our
dominant national traits. Our farmers are
also more widely scattered than is the case
in Europe, and consequently less closely knit
together in social units. Their holdings are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
also larger, their capital needs greater, and
their business instincts more highly developed.</p>

<p>There seems to be no good reason, however,
why the joint-stock mortgage bank should not
flourish here as well as in Europe. It is a
purely private business enterprise of the kind
with which we are perfectly familiar. The
mortgage bond ought to appeal to our investors,
many of whom have exhibited a strong
predilection for mortgage security and real
estate investments, and long-period mortgage
loans, repayable on the annuity plan, would
meet the needs of many land purchasers and of
people who need to invest considerable sums
in drainage, irrigation works, etc., better than
our present methods. In most, if not all, of our
states, trust companies could develop these new
lines of finance without prejudice to the other
branches of their business.</p>

<p>The use of state, county, and municipal subsidies
or credit in enterprises of this kind is
rendered difficult, if not impossible, in this
country, by strong prejudice against the use
of public funds in private enterprises, and in
some states by constitutional prohibitions. This
prejudice is based upon unfortunate experiences,
and is at least partially justified by the
laxness of our administrative methods and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
prevalence of graft, which expose us to the
danger of the improper use of public funds
devoted to enterprises of this kind. There is
no reason, however, why our states should not
take the initiative in the improvement of our
investment banking machinery and why private
capitalists and philanthropists should not turn
some of their energy into this channel.</p>

<p>Suggestion and leadership are needed in this
field quite as much as legislation tending to
restrict and regulate the operations of existing
institutions.</p>
